That 's true ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "We have to remove it ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc A", "content": "I  I agree with that part , but I think that it would  it , uh  we need to have , uh , a  a  a message to them very clearly that  beyond this date , you can't make additional changes ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "I mean , um , I  I   i I think that somebody might  request something even though we say that .

Good ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So if we agreed ,  OK , how long is a reasonable amount of time for people to have  if we say two weeks , or if we say a month , I think we should just say that  say that , you know , i a as  um ,  \" per the  the  the , uh , page you signed , you have the ability to look over this stuff \" and so forth \" and , uh , because we w \" these , uh  I would  I would imagine some sort of generic thing that would say \" because we , uh , will continually be making these things available  to other researchers , uh , this can't be open - ended and so , uh , uh , please give us back your response within this am you know , within this amount of time \" , whatever time we agree upon ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "Well , did you read the email and look at the pages I sent ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Did I ?

OK , so "}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "And if you disagree with it , why don't you read it and give me comments on it ?"}, {"speaker": "Postdoc A", "content": "Yeah . Well  I  I think that there 's one missing line ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Well , the one thing that I did read and that you just repeated to me  was that you gave the specific date of July fifteenth ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "And you also just said that the reason you said that was because someone said it to you . So what I 'm telling you  is that what you should do is come up with a length of time that you guys think is enough"}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "and you should use that rather than  this date that you just got from somewhere .

This is in the summer period and presumably people may be out of town . But we can make the assumption , can't we ? that , um , they will be receiving email , uh , most of the month . Right ?

Sometimes somebody will be  away and , uh , you know , there 's , uh  for any length of time that you  uh , choose  there is some person sometime who will not  end up reading it ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc A", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "That 's  it 's , you know , just a certain risk to take ."}, {"speaker": "PhD H", "content": "S so maybe when  Am I on , by the way ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "I don't know . You should be ."}, {"speaker": "PhD H", "content": "Oh . Hello ? Hello ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "You should be channel B ."}, {"speaker": "PhD H", "content": "Oh , OK . Alright . So . The , um  Maybe we should say in  w you know , when the whole thing starts , when they sign the   the agreement  that  you know , specify exactly uh , what , you know , how  how they will be contacted and they can , you know  they can be asked to give a phone number and an email address , or both .

A And , then , you know , say very clearly that if they don't  if we don't hear from them , you know , as Morgan suggested , by a certain time or after a certain  period after we contact them  that is implicitly giving their agreement ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "Well , they 've already signed a form ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc A", "content": "And the form says "}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "And nobody  nobody really reads it anyway ."}, {"speaker": "PhD H", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "So .

And , um , well , so , I mentioned the process that I 'm going through with the data , so , you know , I get the data back from the transcri Well , s uh , metaphorically , get the data back from the transcriber , and then I , check for simple things like spelling errors and things like that . And , um , I 'm going to be doing a more thorough editing , with respect to consistency of the conventions . But they 're  they 're generally very good . And , then , I run it through , uh , the channelize program to get it into the multi - channel format , OK . And  the , what we discussed this morning , I would summarize as saying that , um , these units that result , in a  a particular channel and a particular timeband , at  at that level , um , vary in length . And , um ,  their recognizer would prefer that the units not be overly long . But it 's really an empirical question , whether the units we get at this point through , just that process I described might be sufficient for them . So , as a first pass through , a first chance without having to do a lot of hand - editing , what we 're gonna do , is , I 'll run it through channelize , give them those data after I 've done the editing process and be sure it 's clean . And I can do that , pretty quickly , with just , that minimal editing , without having to hand - break things ."}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc B", "content": "And then we 'll see if the units that we 're getting , uh , with the  at that level , are sufficient .

Um , and also I 'll be , um , encoding , as I do my post - editing , the , things that are in curly brackets , which are clarificational material .

So if they hear a breath and they don't know who breath it is it 's better to put it in that channel than to put it in the speaker 's channel because maybe it was someone else 's breath , or  Uh , so I think that 's a good  you can always clean that up , post - processing ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc B", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "So a lot of little details , but I think we 're , coming to some kinda closure , on that . So the idea is then , uh , Don can take , uh , Jane 's post - processed channelized version , and , with some scripts , you know , convert that to  to a reference for the recognizer and we can , can run these . So  when that 's , ready  you know , as soon as that 's ready , and as soon as the recognizer is here we can get , twelve hours of force - aligned and recognized data .

Well ,  I realize that , um , w i we we 're using the pre - segmented version , and , um , the pre - segmented version is extremely useful , and wouldn't it be , useful also to have the visual representation of those segments ? And so I 've   uh ,  I , uh , uh , I 've {comment} trained the new one  uh , the new the newest one ,  to , um ,  use the visual from the channel that is gonna be transcribed at any given time .

And , uh , Liz and Andreas  actually they 're not here , but , they did say at one point that they thought they could do a pretty good job of just doing a forced alignment . And , again , I don't think we 'll be able to do with that alone , because , um , sometimes people correct themselves and things like that .

And , um ,  there 's the issue that  that they  we know what  what was said , but do we ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "I mean , so one option i"}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Because people make mistakes and stuff . I was just asking , just out of curiosity , if  if with , uh  uh , the SRI recognizer getting one percent word error , uh , would we  would we do  better  ?

Yes , we have  I don't know , did you wanna talk about it , or  ? I can give a  I was just telling this to Jane and  and  W we  we were able to get some definite improvement on the forced alignments by looking at them first and then realizing the kinds of errors  that were occurring and um , some of the errors occurring very frequently are just things like the first word being moved to as early as possible in the recognition , which is a um , I think was both a  a pruning  problem and possibly a problem with needing constraints on word locations . And so we tried both of these st things . We tried saying  I don't know , I got this  whacky idea that  just from looking at the data , that when people talk  their words are usually chunked together . It 's not that they say one word and then there 's a bunch of words together . They 're {comment} might say one word and then another word far away if they were doing just backchannels ? But in general , if there 's , like , five or six words and one word 's far away from it , that 's probably wrong on average . So , um  And then also , ca the pruning , of course , was too  too severe ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "So that 's actually interesting . The pruning was the same value that we used for recognition . And we had lowered that  we had used tighter pruning after Liz ran some experiments showing that , you know , it runs slower and there 's no real difference in "}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Actually it was better with  slightly better or about th"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "No gain ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "it was the same with tighter pruning ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Right . So for free recognition , this  the lower pruning value is better ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "It 's probably cuz the recognition 's just bad en at a point where it 's bad enough that  that you don't lose anything ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "You  Correct . Right . Um , but it turned out for  for  to get accurate alignments it was really important to open up the pruning significantly ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Um  because otherwise it would sort of do greedy alignment , um , in regions where there was no real speech yet from the foreground speaker ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Um ,  so that was one big factor that helped improve things and then the other thing was that , you know , as Liz said the  we f enforce the fact that , uh , the foreground speech has to be continuous . It cannot be  you cannot have a background speech hypothesis in the middle of the foreground speech . You can only have background speech at the beginning and the end ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yeah . I mean , yeah , it isn't always true , and I think what we really want is some clever way to do this , where , um , you know , from the data or from maybe some hand - corrected alignments from transcribers that things like words that do occur just by themselves  a alone , like backchannels or something that we did allow to have background speech around it "}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "those would be able to do that ,"}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "Sorry ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "but the rest would be constrained . So , I think we have a version that 's pretty good for the native speakers . I don't know yet about the non - native speakers . And , um , we basically also made noise models for the different  sort of grouped some of the  mouth noises together . Um , so , and then there 's a background speech model . And we also  There was some neat  or , interesting cases , like there 's one meeting where ,  um , Jose 's giving a presentation and he 's talking about , um , the word \" mixed  signal \" and someone didn't understand , uh , that you were saying \" mixed \"  I think , Morgan . And so your speech - ch was s saying something about mixed signal ."}, {"speaker": "PhD H", "content": "Yeah , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "And the next turn was a lot of people saying \" mixed \" , like \" he means mixed signal \" or \" I think it 's mixed \" .

I mean , in general we actually "}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "And "}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Right now the words like  partial words are  reject models and you normally allow those to match to any word ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "But then the background speech was also a reject model , and so this constraint of not allowing rejects in between  you know , it needs to differentiate between the two .

Analogously the same on the object information we can see that , you know , we have sort of created these tasks before we came up with our decision nodes so there 's a lot of things where we have no analogous tasks , and  that may or may not be a problem . We can change the tasks slightly if we feel that we should have data for e sort of for every decision node so  trying to im um  implant the intention of going to a place now , going to a place later on the same tour , or trying to plant the intention of going sometime on the next tour , or the next day or whenever ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Right , right ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "But I think that might be overdoing it a little ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "So  Yeah . So let me pop up a level . And uh s s make sure that we 're all oriented the same . So What we 're gonna do today is two related things . Uh one of them is to work on the semantics of the belief - net which is going to be the main inference engine for thi the system uh making decisions . And decisions are going to turn out to be parameter choices for calls on other modules . so f the natural language understanding thing is uh , we think gonna only have to choose parameters , but You know , a fairly large set of parameters . So to do that , we need to do two things . One of which is figure out what all the choices are , which we 've done a fair amount . Then we need to figure out what influences its choices and finally we have to do some technical work on the actual belief relations and presumably estimates of the probabilities and stuff . But we aren't gonna do the probability stuff today . Technical stuff we 'll do  uh  another day . Probably next week . But we are gonna worry about all the decisions and the things that pert that contribute to them . And we 're also , sort of uh in the same process , going to work with Fey on what there should be in the dialogues . So One of the s steps that 's coming up real soon is to actually get subjects uh  in here , and have them actually record like this . Uh record dialogues more or less .

So what Robert kindly did , is to lay out a table of the kinds of uh  things that  that might come up , and , the kinds of decisions . So the uh  uh  on the left are decision nodes , and discreet values .

That was the uh  the data collection in a nutshell . And um  I can report a  so I did this but I also tried to do this  so if I click on here , Isn't this wonderful ? we get to the uh  uh belief - net just focusing on  on the g Go - there node . uh  Analogously this would be sort of the reason node and the timing node and so forth ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "And what w what happened is that um design - wise I 'd sort of n noticed that we can  we still get a lot of errors from a lot of points to one of these sub Go - there User Go - there Situation nodes . So I came up with a couple of additional nodes here where um whether the user is thrifty or not , and what his budget is currently like , is going to result in some financial state of the user . How much will he  is he willing to spend ? Or can spend . Being the same at this  just the money available , which may influence us , whether he wants to go there if it is  you know  charging tons of dollars for admission or its gonna g cost a lot of t e whatever . Twenty - two million to fly to International Space Station , you know . just  Not all people can do that ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "So , and this actually turned out to be pretty key , because having specified sort of these  uh  this  this  intermediate level Um and sort of noticing that everything that happens here  let 's go to our favorite endpoint one is again more or less  we have  um  then the situation nodes contributing to the  the endpoint situation node , which contributes to the endpoint and so forth . um  I can now sort of draw straight lines from these to here , meaning it g of course goes where the sub - S  everything that comes from situation , everything that comes from user goes with the sub - U , and whatever we specify for the so - called \" Keith node \" , or the discourse , what comes from the  um  parser , construction parser , um will contribute to the D and the ontology to the sub - O node . And um one just s sort of has to watch which  also final decision node so it doesn't make sense  t to figure out whether he wants to enter , view or approach an object if he never wants to go there in the first place . But this makes the design thing fairly simple . And um now all w that 's left to do then is the CPG 's , the conditional probabilities , for the likelihood of a person having enough money , actually wanting to go a place if it costs , you know this or that . And um  OK . and once um Bhaskara has finished his classwork that 's where we 're gonna end up doing . You get involved in that process too .

Yeah . Yeah , so  let 's s uh s see I th I think that from one point of view , Uh , um , all these places are the same , so that d d That , um  in terms of the linguistics and stuff , there may be a few different kinds of places , so I th i it seems to me that We ought to decide you know , what things are k are actually going to matter to us .

Yeah . Right ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "but  but  but  uh , to orthogonalize them  but   but they were not , uh , processed through a neural net .

Um , so , I 've be just been looking at , um , Ack ! What are you doing ? Yeah . OK . Um , I 've been looking at the PRM stuff . Um , so , this is , sort of like the latest thing I have on it , and I sorta constructed a couple of classes . Like , a user class , a site class , and  and you know , a time , a route , and then  and a query class . And I tried to simplify it down a little bit , so that I can actually um , look at it more . It 's the same paper that I gave to Jerry last time . Um , so basically I took out a lot of stuff , a lot of the decision nodes , and then tried to  The red lines on the , um , graph are the um , relations between the different um , classes . Like , a user has like , a query , and then , also has , you know um , reference slots to its preferences , um , the special needs and , you know , money , and the user interest . And so this is more or less similar to the flat Bayes - net that I have , you know , with the input nodes and all that . And  So I tried to construct the dependency models , and a lot of these stuff I got from the flat Bayes - net , and what they depend on , and it turns out , you know , the CPT 's are really big , if I do that , so I tried to see how I can do , um  put in the computational nodes in between . And what that would look like in a PRM . And so I ended up making several classes  Actually , you know , a class of  with different attributes that are the intermediate nodes , and one of them is like , time affordability money affordability , site availability , and the travel compatibility . And so some of these classes are  s some of these attributes only depend on stuff from , say , the user , or s f just from , I don't know , like the site . S like , um , these here , it 's only like , user , but , if you look at travel compatibility for each of these factors , you need to look at a pair of , you know , what the um , preference of the user is versus , you know , what type of an event it is , or you know , which form of transportation the user has and whether , you know , the onsite parking matters to the user , in that case . And that makes the scenario a little different in a PRM , because , um , then you have one - user objects and potentially you can have many different sites in  in mind . And so for each of the site you 'll come up with this rating , of travel compatibility . And , they all depend on the same users , but different sites , and that makes a  I 'm tr I w I wa have been trying to see whether the PRM would make it more efficient if we do inferencing like that . And so , I guess you end up having fewer number of nodes than in a flat Bayes - net , cuz otherwise you would  c well , it 's probably the same . But um , No , you would definitely have  be able to re - use , like ,  um , all the user stuff , and not  not having to recompute a lot of the stuff , because it 's all from the user side . So if you changed sites , you  you can , you know , save some work on that . But , you know , in the case where , it depends on both the user and the site , then I 'm still having a hard time trying to see how um , using the PRM will help . Um , so anyhow , using those intermediate nodes then , this  this would be the class that represent the intermediate nodes . And that would  basically it 's just another class in the model , with , you know , references to the user and the site and the time . And then , after you group them together this  no the dependencies would  of the queries would be reduced to this . And so , you know , it 's easier to specify the CPT and all . Um , so I think that 's about as far as I 've gone on the PRM stuff ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Well"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "No . So y you didn't yet tell us what the output is ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "The output ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "So what decisions does this make ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "OK . So it only makes two decisions , in this model . And one is basically how desirable a site is meaning , um , how good it matches the needs of a user . And the other is the mode of the visit , whether th It 's the EVA decision . Um , so , instead of um ,  doing a lot of , you know , computation about , you know , which one site it wants of  the user wants to visit , I 'll come  well , try to come up with like , sort of a list of sites . And for each site , you know , where  h how  how well it fits , and basically a rating of how well it fits and what to do with it . So . Anything else I missed ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "So that was pretty quick .

Uh , so one of the things that Eva 's gonna do over the next few weeks is see if we can track that down . Uh , the people at Stanford write papers as if they had one , but , um , we 'll see . So w Anyway . So that 's a  a major open issue . If there is an interpreter , it looks like you know , what Eva 's got should run and we should be able to actually um , try to solve , you know , the problems , to actually take the data , and do it . Uh , and we 'll see . Uh , I actually think it is cleaner , and the ability to instantiate , you know , instance of people and sites and stuff , um , will help in the expression .

I think there are things that you can express this way which you can't express in a normal belief - net , uh , without going to some incredible hacking of  sort of rebuilding it on the fly . I mean , the notion of instantiating your el elements from the ontology and stuff fits this very nicely and doesn't fit very well into the extended belief - net . So that was one of the main reasons for doing it . Um . I don't know . So , uh , people who have thought about the problem , like Robert i it looked to me like if {comment} Eva were able to come up with a  you know , value for each of a number of uh , sites plus its EVA thing , that a travel planner should be able to take it from there .

Then , we can move on and see what Andreas has got out his sleeve . Or Andy , for that matter ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "OK . So uh , uh , well , thanks for having me here , first of all . Um , so maybe just a  a little background on  on my visit . So , uh , I 'm not really involved in any project , that 's uh  that 's relevant to you uh , a at the moment , uh , the  the reason is really for me uh , to have an opportunity to talk to some other researchers in the field . And  and so I 'll just n sort of give you a real quick introduction to what I 'm working on , and um , I just hope that you have some comments or , maybe you 're interested in it to find out more , and  and so I 'll be uh , happy to talk to you and  and uh , I 'd also like to find out some more and  and maybe I 'll just walk around the office and and then  and ask some  some questions , uh , in a couple days . So I 'll be here for uh , tomorrow and then uh , the remainder of uh , next week . OK , so , um , what I started looking at , uh , to begin with is just uh , content management systems uh , i i in general . So um , uh what 's uh  Sort of the state of the art there is to um  uh you have a bunch of  of uh documents or learning units or learning objects , um , and you store meta - data uh , associate to them . So there 's some international standards like the I - triple - E , uh  There 's an I - triple - E , LON standard , and um , these fields are pretty straightforward , you have uh author information , you have uh , size information , format information and so on . Uh , but they 're two uh fields that are um , more interesting . One is uh you store keywords associated with the uh  with the document , and one is uh , you have sort of a , um , well , what is the document about ? So it 's some sort of taxonomic uh , ordering of  of the  of the units . Now , if you sort of put on your semantic glasses , uh you say , well that 's not all that easy , because there 's an implicit um , uh , assumption behind that is that uh , all the users of this system share the same interpretation of the keyword and the same interpretation of uh , whichever taxonomy is used , and uh , I think that 's a  that 's a very  that 's a key point of these systems and they sort of always brush over this real quickly without really elaborating much of that and uh  As a matter of fact , the only thing that m apparently really works out so far are library ordering codes , which are very , very coarse grain , so you have some like , science , biology , and then  But that 's really all that we have at the moment . So I think there 's a huge , um , uh need for improvement there . Now , what this uh  a standard like this would give us is we could um , sort of uh with a search engine just query uh , different repositories all over the world . But we can't really  Um , so what I 'm  what I try to do is um , to have um , uh  So . So the scenario is the following , you you 're working on some sort of project and you encounter a certain problem . Now , what  what we have at our university quite a bit is that uh , students um , try to u program a certain assignment , for example , they always run into the same problems , uh , and they always come running to us , and they 'll say why 's it not  it 's not working , and we always give out the same answer , so we thought , well , it 'd be nice to have a system that could sort of take care of this , and so , what I want to build is basically a  a smart F A Q system . Now , what you uh need to do here is you need to provide some context information which is more elaborate than \" I 'm looking for this and this and this keyword . \" So . And I think that I don't need to tell you this . I 'm  I 'm sure you have the same  when  when somebody utters a sentence in a certain , uh , context it , and  and the same sentence in another context makes a huge difference . So , I want to be able to model information like , um , so in the  in the context of  in the context of developing distributed systems , of a at a computer science school , um , what kind of software is the person using , which homework assignment is he or she working on at the moment , um , maybe what 's the background of that student 's um , which um , which error message was encountered . So this sort of information I think should be transmitted , uh , when a certain document is retrieved . Now , um , basically giving this um  Uh so we somehow need to have a formalized um , way of writing this down basically , and that 's where the shared interpretation of  of certain terms and keywords comes in again . And , using this and some  some uh , knowledge about the domain I think you can do some  some simple inferences . Like you know that when somebody 's working about  uh , working on  on servlets for example , he 's using Java , cuz servlets are used  are written in Java . So some  some inferences like that , now , um , u using this you can infer more information , and you could then match this to the meta - data of um  off the documents you 're  you 're searching against . So , uh what I wanna do is basically have some sort of um  given these inputs , and then I can compute how many documents match , and use this as a metric in the search . Now , what I plan to do is I want to uh sort of do a uh  uh  try to improve the quality of the search results , and I want to do this by having a depth uh , um , um  steepest descent approach . So if I knew which operating system the person was working on , would this improve my search result ? And  and having uh , uh a symbolic formalized model of this I could simply compute that , and find out which um  which questions are worth um , asking . And that 's what I then propagate back to the user , and  and sort of try to optimize the search in this way . Now , the big problem that I 'm facing right now is um , it 's fairly easy to hack up a system uh quickly , that  that works in the small domain , but the problem is obviously the scalability . And uh uh , so Robert was mentioning uh , earlier today is that uh , Microsoft for example with their printer set up program has a Bayesian network , which does exactly this , but there you face a problem that these are very hard to extend . And so , uh what I 'm  What I try to do is basically try to model this uh , in a way that you could really combine uh , knowledge from very different sources , and  and um , sort of looking into some of the ideas that the semantic web community uh , came up with . Trying to  to have uh , an approach how to integrate s uh certain uh  representation of certain concepts and also some computational rules , um , what you can do with those . Um . What I 'm also looking into is a probabilistic approach into this because document retrievals is a very fuzzy procedure , so it 's probably not that easy to simply have a symbolic uh , computational model . That  that probably isn't expressive enough . So . So that 's another thing , um , which I think you 're also uh , uh looking into right now . And then um , uh sort of as an add - on to this whole idea , um , uh that would be now , depending on what the search engine or the content repository  depending on which  um , uh , which uh , rules and which ontologies it  it uses , or basically its view of the world , uh you can get very different results . So it might ma make a lot of sense to actually query a lot of different search engines . And there you could have an idea where you actually have sort of a  a peer to peer approach , where we 're all sort of carrying around our individual bookshelves , and um , if you have a question about a homework , it 's  probably makes sense to ask somebody who 's in your class with you , sort of the guru in the certain area , rather than going to some Yahoo - like uh , search engine . So these are some of the  just in a nutshell , some of the ideas . And I think a lot of the  even though it 's a  it 's a very different domain , but I think a lot of the , um , issues are  are fairly similar . So . OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "And so some of the  I don't know how much you know about the larger Heidelberg project , I  Are you "}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Uh I know , yeah I know abou about it ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "So it seems like a lot of  some of the issues are the same .

In fact he 's hired to run a lot of CITRIS , even though we don't have the money they  So they 've been hiring people right and left , so , uh , they think the money 's coming .

And , is now doing all the politics for CITRIS , but also , has a uh , a lot of interest in uh , actually doing things for society , so digital divide and stuff like that . So that 's s interesting to me but maybe not to you . But the really interesting thing was , he st he s he s said something about , you know I 'm interested in things that have high social multiplier , something that is of great social value . He said , \" for example \" , this was his only example , \" if you had a adult literacy program that was as good as an individual tutor , and as compelling as a video game , then that would have a huge social impact \" . I said , \" Oh great ! That 's a good problem to work on . \" Anyway .

I don't know . So this is reading , rather than teaching  Another project we started on , and  and didn't get funded for was , uh , to try to build an automatic tutoring program , for kids whose first language wasn't English .

Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "An"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah there is something funny happening here because  yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "But there are thirty - six and then sometimes we are  we are  we are around forty - two and"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Now up"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "but"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Uh so one of the ideas that you had mentioned last time was having a  a second um silence detection ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah . So there are some results here"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "For the Italian ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "uh so the third and the fifth line of the table"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "For this one ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So filt is what that is ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Filt , yeah"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Um yeah so it seems f for the  the well match and mismatched condition it 's uh it brings something . Uh but uh actually apparently there are  there 's no room left for any silence detector at the server side because of the delay . Uh well"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Oh we can't do it . Oh OK ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "No ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "For that  for that we "}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Oh ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Uh"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Too bad . Good idea , but can't do it ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Except I don't know because they  I think they are still working well ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Uh - huh ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Uh t two days ago they were still working on this trying to reduce the delay of the silence detector so but yeah if we had time perhaps we could try to find uh some kind of compromise between the delay that 's on the handset and on the server side . Perhaps try to reduce the delay on the handset and  but well hmm For the moment they have this large delay on the  the feature computation and so we don't"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "OK . So Alright so for now at least that 's not there you have some results with low - pass filter cepstrum doesn't have a huge effect but it  but it looks like it you know maybe could help in a couple places ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "I th"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Uh little bit ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Um and um um Yeah and uh let 's see What else did we have in there ? Uh I guess it makes a l um at this point this is I  I guess I should probably look at these others a little bit uh And you  you yellowed these out uh but uh uh Oh I see yeah that  that one you can't use because of the delay . Those look pretty good . Um let 's see that one Well even the  just the  the second row doesn't look that bad right ? That 's just uh yeah ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yep ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "And  and that looks like an interesting one too ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Mmm yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Uh"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Actually the  yeah the second line is uh pretty much like the first line in yellow except that we don't have this KLT on the first  on the left part of the diagram . We just have the features as they are ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Um"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah . Yeah so when we do this weighted measure we should compare the two cuz it might even come out better . And it 's  it 's  it 's a little  slightly simpler ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Mm - hmm . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So  so there 's  so I  I would put that one also as a  as a maybe . Uh and it  yeah and it 's actually  does  does significantly better on the uh uh highly mismatched Italian , so s and little worse on the mis on the MM case , but uh Well yeah it 's worse than a few things"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "so uh let 's see how that c that c c see how that comes out on their  their measure and  are  are we running this uh for TI - digits or uh"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Now is TI di  is is that part of the result that they get for the uh development  th the results that they 're supposed to get at the end of  end of the month , the TI - digits are there also ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah . Yeah . It 's included , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Oh OK . OK . And see what else there is here . Um Oh I see  the one  I was looking down here at the  the o the row below the lower yellowed one . Uh that 's uh that 's with the reduced uh KLT size  reduced dimensionality ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Mm - hmm ? Yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "What happens there is it 's around the same and so you could reduce the dimension as you were saying before a bit perhaps ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah , it 's  it 's significantly worse well but  Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "It 's significantly worse  it 's  it 's uh it 's  it 's mostly worse ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Exc - except for the HM"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "For many a mismatch it 's worse ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "but"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah . But it is little . I mean not  not by a huge amount , I don't know . What are  what are the sizes of any of these sets , I  I 'm  I 'm sure you told me before , but I 've forgotten . So  you know how many words are in uh one of these test sets ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Uh"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "I don't remember ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "About ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Um it 's  it depends  well  the well matched is generally larger than the other sets and I think it 's around two thousand or three thousand words perhaps , at least ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Ye But words  well word  I don't know ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Hmm ? The words , yeah . S sentences ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Sentences ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Some sets have five hundred sentences , so ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So the  so the sets  so the test sets are between five hundred and two thousand sentences , let 's say"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Mmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "and each sentence on the average has four or five digits or is it  most of them longer or"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah for the Italian even seven digits y more or less"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "It  it d Seven digits ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "but sometime the sentence have only one digit and sometime uh like uh the number of uh credit cards , something like that ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Mm - hmm . Right , so between one and sixteen . See the  I mean the reason I 'm asking is  is  is we have all these small differences and I don't know how seriously to take them , right ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Mm - hmm ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So uh i if  if you had uh just you know  to give an example , if you had uh um if you had a thousand words then uh a  a tenth of a percent would just be one word ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "right ? So  so it wouldn't mean anything ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Oh"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "um so um yeah it be kind of  I 'd kind of like to know what the sizes of these test sets were actually ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "The size that we have ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "We could  we could run  run some kind of significance tests"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah since these  well also just to know the numbers ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "or"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "right . So these  these are word error rates"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "so this is on how many words ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yep ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah we have the result that the output of the HTK"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "The number of  of sentences , no it 's the number isn't ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah sure  sure . Yeah sure ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah so anyway if you could just mail out what those numbers are and then  then  that  that be great ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Um  what else is there here ? Um see the second  second from the bottom it says SIL , but this is some different kind of silence or thing or  what was that ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Uh"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "It the  the output silence of the MLP ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Oh yeah I see ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "It 's only one small experiment to know what happened . To apply also to in include also the  the silence of the MLP we have the fifty - six form and the silence to pick up the silence and we include those ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yes . Uh - huh , uh - huh . The silence plus the KLT output ? Oh so you 're only using the silence ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah , because when we apply the KLT"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "No they 're  I think there is this silence in addition to the um KLT outputs"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "No ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "in addition , yes ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "it is because we  we  we just keep uh we don't keep all the dimensions after the KLT"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "In addition t"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "and  yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "and we not s we are not sure if we pick  we have the silence ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "So we try to add the silence also in addition to the  these twenty - eight dimensions ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "I see . OK . And what  and what 's OGI forty - five ? The bottom one there ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Uh it 's o it 's OGI two , it 's  so the  th it 's the features from the first line"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "It 's in fact OGI two ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "S"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "and  yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Right , but I mean what 's the  what does the last row mean ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "So it 's uh basically this but without the KLT on the  from the left path ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "I thought that was the one  I thought that was the second row . So what 's the difference between the second"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Uh the second line you don't have this combo stuff so you just"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Oh ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "uh"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So this is like the second line but with  with the combo stuff ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "And with the  all the output of the combo ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "OK . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Uh"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "OK , so  alright so it looks to me  I guess the same  given that we have to take the filt ones out of the  the running because of this delay problem  so it looks to me like the ones you said I agree are  are the ones to look at"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "but I just would add the  the  the second row one"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "and then um if we can um"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Mmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "oh yeah also when  when they 're using this weighting scheme of forty , thirty - five , twenty - five is that on the percentages or on the raw errors ? I guess it 's probably on the percentages right ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Uh  I guess , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah OK ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "I guess , yeah . Mmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Alright ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "It 's not clear here ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "OK . Maybe  maybe they 'll argue about it .

Mmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "that 's  that 's  that 's not proper but if this is development data we could still look at a couple ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah . We can  yeah . Sure . But we have to decide  I mean we have to fix the system on this d on this data , to choose the best"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah . I Right ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "and these"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "But the question is when  when do we fix the system ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "But we could"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "do we fix the system uh tomorrow or do we fix the system on Tuesday ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "it d"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "I  Yeah , OK except that we do have to write it up ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "I think we fixed on Tuesday , yeah . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Also , so"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Um"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Uh yeah well . Well basically it 's this with perhaps some kind of printing and some  some other @ @ ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Right so maybe what we do is we  we  we uh as soon as we get the data from them we start the training and so forth"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah but Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "but we start the write - up right away because as you say there  there 's only minor differences between these ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "I think you  we could  we could start soon , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Write up something ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah , and  and I  I would  you know , I would  I 'd kind of like to see it"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Um yeah . Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "maybe I can  I can edit it a bit uh sure . The  my  what in this si i in this situation is my forte which is English ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Uh so"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Mmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "uh H yeah . Have y have you seen alt d do they have a format for how they want the system descriptions or anything ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Uh not really ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Um There is the format of the table which is  quite impressive ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah ? Uh I see . Yes , for those who are listening to this and not looking at it uh it 's not really that impressive , it 's just tiny . It 's all these little categories set a , set b , set c , multi - condition , clean . Uh No mitigation . Wow . Do you know what no  what no mitigation means here ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Um it should be the the problem with the error  channel error"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Oh that 's probably the "}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "or"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "this is probably channel error stuff"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "well , you "}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "huh ? Oh this is i right , it says right above here channel  channel error resilience ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "yeah . So recognition performance is just the top part , actually . Uh and they have  yes , split between seen databases and non - seen so basically between development and  and evaluation ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "And  so  right , it 's presumed there 's all sorts of tuning that 's gone on on the see what they call seen databases and there won't be tuning for the uh unseen .

Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "was like  I thought it was five PM or something , I didn't think it was midnight .

So when we 're doing all these things using our software there is  um if it 's  if it 's based on the RASTA - PLP program ,  which does both PLP and RASTA - PLP  um then  uh there is an option there which then comes up through to Feacalc which  um allows you to do high - pass filtering and in general we like to do that , because of things like this and  it 's  it 's pretty  it 's not a very severe filter . Doesn't affect speech frequencies , even pretty low speech frequencies , at all , but it 's"}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "What 's the  cut - off frequency it used ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Oh .

I think we use a pre - emphasis . Yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "So . We  we  we want to go and check that in i for anything that we 're going to use the P D A mike for .  uh He says that there 's a pretty good roll off in the PZM mikes so  we don't need  need to worry about them one way or the other but if we do make use of the cheap mikes ,  uh we want to be sure to do that  that filtering before we  process it . And then again if it 's uh depending on the option that the  our  our software is being run with , it 's  it 's quite possible that 's already being taken care of . uh But I also have to pick a different picture to show the effects of reverberation . uh"}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Did somebody notice it during your talk ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "uh No ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Huh ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Well . uh Well . If they made output they were  they were , you know  they were nice ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Didn't say anything ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "But .  I mean the thing is it was since I was talking about reverberation and showing this thing that was noise , it wasn't a good match , but it certainly was still uh an indication of the fact that you get noise with distant mikes . uh It 's just not a great example because not only isn't it reverberation but it 's a noise that we definitely know what to do ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "So , I mean , it doesn't take deep   a new  bold new methods to get rid of uh five hertz noise , so ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "um  uh But . So it was  it was a bad example in that way , but it 's  it still is  it 's the real thing that we did get out of the microphone at distance , so it wasn't  it w it w wasn't wrong it was inappropriate .

So .  um So I think we 'll change our  our picture on the web , when we 're @ @ . One of the things I was  I mean , I was trying to think about what  what 's the best  way to show the difference an and I had a couple of thoughts one was ,  that spectrogram that we show  is O K , but the thing is  the eyes uh and the  the brain behind them are so good at picking out patterns  from  from noise  that in first glance you look at them it doesn't seem like it 's that bad uh because there 's many features that are still preserved . So one thing to do might be to just take a piece of the spec uh of the spectrogram where you can see  that something looks different , an and blow it up , and have that be the part that 's  just to show as well . You know ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "i i Some things are going to be hurt . um  Another , I was thinking of was um  taking some spectral slices , like uh  like we look at with the recognizer , and look at the spectrum or cepstrum that you get out of there , and the  the uh , um ,  the reverberation uh does make it  does change that .

You said on the other cases you didn't notice "}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Yeah . But . I think , yeah . I think the reason is , yeah , I not I  it was in my mail I think also ,  is the fact that the mismatch is trained only on the far microphone .

Yes ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "So . And that  that says that we could have lots more parameters actually ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "I did one quick experiment just to make sure I had everything worked out and I just   uh f for most of the um  For  for all of the digit models , they end up at three mixtures per state . And so I just did a quick experiment , where I changed it so it went to four and um  it it  it didn't have a r any significant effect at the uh medium mismatch and high mismatch cases and it had   it was just barely significant for the well - matched better . Uh so I 'm r gonna run that again but  um with many more uh mixtures per state ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Yeah . Cuz at forty thou I mean you could you could have uh  Yeah , easily four times as many  parameters ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Mm - hmm . And I think also  just seeing what we saw  uh in terms of the expected duration of the silence model ? when we did this tweaking of the self - loop ? The silence model expected duration was really different ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "And so in the case where  um  it had a better score , the silence model expected duration was much longer ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "So it was like   it was a better match . I think  you know if we make a better silence model I think that will help a lot too um for a lot of these cases so but one one thing I  I wanted to check out before I increased the um  number of mixtures per state was  uh  in their  default training script they do an initial set of three re - estimations and then they built the silence model and then they do seven iterations then the add mixtures and they do another seven then they add mixtures then they do a final set of seven and they quit . Seven seems like a lot to me and it also makes the experiments go take a really long time I mean to do one turn - around of the well matched case takes like a day ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "And so  you know in trying to run these experiments I notice , you know , it 's difficult to find machines , you know , compute the run on .

I 'll let you know what  what happens with that .

So I wanted to experiment with cutting down the number of iterations before I  increased the number of Gaussians ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Right . Sorry . So um , how 's it going on the "}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Um ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "So . You  you did some things . They didn't improve things in a way that convinced you you 'd substantially improved anything ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "But they 're not making things worse and we have reduced latency , right ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Yeah . But actually  um actually it seems to do a little bit worse for the well - matched case and we just noticed that  Yeah , actually the way the final score is computed is quite funny . It 's not a mean of word error rate . It 's not a weighted mean of word error rate , it 's a weighted mean of improvements ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Uh - huh ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "So . Which means that  actually the weight on the well - matched is  Well I well what what  What happened is that if you have a small improvement or a small if on the well - matched case  it will have uh huge influence on the improvement compared to the reference because the reference system is  is  is quite good for  for the well - ma well - matched case also ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "So it  it weights the improvement on the well - matched case really heavily compared to the improvement on the other cases ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "No , but it 's the weighting of the  of the improvement not of the error rate ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Yeah . Yeah , and it 's hard to improve on the  on the best case , cuz it 's already so good , right ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Yeah but  what I mean is that you can have a huge improvement on the H  HMK 's , uh like five percent uh absolute , and this will not affect the final score almost  Uh this will almost not affect the final score because  this improvement  because the improvement  uh relative to the  the baseline is small "}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "So they do improvement in terms of uh accuracy ? rather than word error rate ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Uh . Uh improvement ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "So "}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "No , it 's compared to the word er it 's improvement on the word error rate ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "yeah . Sorry ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "So if you have uh ten percent error and you get five percent absolute uh  improvement then that 's fifty percent ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "OK . So what you 're saying then is that if it 's something that has a small word error rate ,  then uh a  even a relatively small improvement on it , in absolute terms ,  will show up as quite  quite large in this ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Is that what you 're saying ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Yes ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "OK . But yeah that 's  that 's  it 's the notion of relative improvement . Word error rate ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Yeah . Sure , but when we think about the weighting , which is point five , point three , point two ,  it 's on absolute on  on relative figures ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "not "}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "So when we look at this error rate"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "No .

Oh , I see . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "If you had ninety percent uh correct  and five percent , five over ninety doesn't look like it 's a big difference , but  five over ten is  is big ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "So just when we were looking at a lot of numbers and  getting sense of what was important ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "I see .

But when you look across a bunch of these and there 's some  some pattern , um  I mean , so eh h here 's all the  if  if in all these different cases  it never gets better , and there 's significant number of cases where it gets worse ,  then you 're probably  hurting things ,  I would say . So um  I mean at the very least that would be a reasonably prediction of what would happen with  with a different test set , that you 're not jiggling things with .

So , um , why don't we  why don't we start with you , Dave , and then , um , we can go on ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Oh , OK ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "So ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "So , um , since we 're looking at putting this , um  mean log m magnitude spectral subtraction , um , into the SmartKom system , I I did a test seeing if , um , it would work using past only {comment} and plus the present to calculate the mean . So , I did a test , um ,  where I used twelve seconds from the past and the present frame to , um , calculate the mean . And "}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Twelve seconds  Twelve  twelve seconds back from the current  frame , is that what you mean ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Uh  Twelve seconds , um , counting back from the end of the current frame ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "OK , OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "yeah . So it was , um , twen I think it was twenty - one frames and that worked out to about twelve seconds ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "And compared to , um , do using a twelve second centered window , I think there was a drop in performance but it was just a slight drop ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Hmm !"}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Is  is that right ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "Um , yeah , I mean , it was pretty  it was pretty tiny . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Uh - huh . So that was encouraging . And , um , that  that  um , that 's encouraging for  for the idea of using it in an interactive system like And , um , another issue I 'm  I 'm thinking about is in the SmartKom system . So say twe twelve seconds in the earlier test seemed like a good length of time , but what happens if you have less than twelve seconds ? And , um  So I w bef before , um  Back in May , I did some experiments using , say , two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds . In those I trained the models using mean subtraction with the means calculated over two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds . And , um , here , I was curious , what if I trained the models using twelve seconds but I f I gave it a situation where the test set I was  subtracted using two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds . And , um  So I did that for about three different conditions . And , um  I mean , I th I think it was , um , four se I think  I think it was , um , something like four seconds and , um , six seconds , and eight seconds . Something like that . And it seems like it  it  it hurts compared to if you actually train the models {comment} using th that same length of time but it  it doesn't hurt that much . Um , u usually less than point five percent , although I think I did see one where it was a point eight percent or so rise in word error rate . But this is , um , w where , um , even if I train on the , uh , model , and mean subtracted it with the same length of time as in the test , it  the word error rate is around , um , ten percent or nine percent . So it doesn't seem like that big a d a difference ."}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "But it  but looking at it the other way , isn't it  what you 're saying that it didn't help you to have the longer time for training , if you were going to have a short time for "}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "That  that 's true .

Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "But  s so I g So I guess the que the question I was trying to get at with those experiments is , \" does it matter what models you use ? Does it matter how much time y you use to calculate the mean when you were , um , tra doing the training data ? \""}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "Right . But I mean the other thing is that that 's  I mean , the other way of looking at this , going back to , uh , mean cepstral subtraction versus RASTA kind of things , is that you could look at mean cepstral subtraction , especially the way you 're doing it , uh , as being a kind of filter . And so , the other thing is just to design a filter . You know , basically you 're  you 're  you 're doing a high - pass filter or a band - pass filter of some sort and  and just design a filter .

And so you may  may just want to think of it as a filter . But , uh , if you do that , then , um , in practice somebody using the SmartKom system , one would think {comment}  if they 're using it for a while , it means that their first utterance , instead of , you know , getting , uh , a forty percent error rate reduction , they 'll get a  uh , over what , uh , you 'd get without this , uh , um , policy , uh , you get thirty percent .

OK ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "and then I look for the minima ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Mmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "I see ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "on the  on  on the bunch of uh fifty frames , right ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "I see ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Mmm . So the interest of this is that , as y with this technique you can estimate u some reasonable noise spectra with only five hundred milliseconds of  of signal , so if the  the n the noise varies a lot , uh , you can track  better track the noise ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "which is not the case if you rely on the voice activity detector .

The only requirement is that you must have , in these five hundred milliseconds segment , {comment} you must have voiced sound at least . Cuz this  these will help you to  to track the  the noise level . Um . So what I did is just to simply replace the VAD - based , uh , noise estimate by this estimate , first on SpeechDat - Car  Well , only on SpeechDat - Car actually . And it 's , uh , slightly worse , like one percent relative compared to the VAD - based  estimates .

Um . Yeah . I , um , also implemented a sp um  spectral whitening idea which is in the , um , Ericsson proposal . Uh , the idea is just to  um , flatten the log , uh , spectrum , um , and to flatten it more if the  the probability of silence is higher . So in this way , you can also reduce  somewhat reduce the musical noise and you reduce the variability if you have different noise shapes , because the  the spectrum becomes more flat in the silence portions . Um . Yeah . With this , no improvement , uh , but there are a lot of parameters that we can play with and , um  Actually , this  this could be seen as a soft version of the frame dropping because , um , you could just put the threshold and say that \" below the threshold , I will flatten  comp completely flatten the  the spectrum \" . And above this threshold , uh , keep the same spectrum . So it would be like frame dropping , because during the silence portions which are below the threshold of voice activity probability , {comment} uh , w you would have some kind of dummy frame which is a perfectly flat spectrum . And this , uh , whitening is something that 's more soft because , um , you whiten  you just , uh , have a function  the whitening is a function of the speech probability , so it 's not a hard decision ."}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Um , so I think maybe it can be used together with frame dropping and when we are not sure about if it 's speech or silence , well , maybe it has something do with this ."}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "It 's interesting .

And  and there 'll probably be self - selection to some extent ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Mmm . Yep ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Uh , so that 's good . Um . Now ,  I signed us up for the Wednesday slot , and part of what we should do is this ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So , my idea on that was  uh , partly we 'll talk about system stuff for the computer scientists , but partly I did want it to get the linguists involved in some of this issue about what the task is and all  um you know , what the dialogue is , and what 's going on linguistically , because to the extent that we can get them contributing , that will be good . So this issue about you know re - formulating things ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yep ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "maybe we can get some of the linguists sufficiently interested that they 'll help us with it , uh , other linguists , if you 're a linguist , but in any case ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yep ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "um , the linguistics students and stuff . So my idea on  on Wednesday is partly to uh  you  I mean , what you did today would  i is just fine . You just uh do \" this is what we did , and here 's the  thing , and here 's s some of the dialogue and  and so forth . \" But then , the other thing of course is we should um give the computer scientists some idea of  of what 's going on with the system design , and where we think the belief - nets fit in and where the pieces are and stuff like that . Is  is this  make sense to everybody ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yep ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah . So , I don't  I don't think it 's worth a lot of work , particularly on your part , to  to  to make a big presentation . I don't think you should  you don't have to make any new  uh PowerPoint or anything . I think we got plenty of stuff to talk about . And , then um just see how a discussion goes ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Mm - hmm . Sounds good . The uh other two things is um we 've  can have Johno tell us a little about this"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Great ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "and we also have a l little bit on the interface , M - three - L enhancement , and then um that was it , I think ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "So , what I did for this  this is  uh , a pedagogical belief - net because I was  I  I took  I tried to conceptually do what you were talking about with the nodes that you could expand out  so what I did was I took  I made these dummy nodes called Trajector - In and Trajector - Out that would isolate the things related to the trajector ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yep ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "And then there were the things with the source and the path and the goal ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yep ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "And I separated them out . And then I um did similar things for our  our net to  uh with the context and the discourse and whatnot , um , so we could sort of isolate them or whatever in terms of the  the top layer ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "And then the bottom layer is just the Mode . So ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So , let 's  let 's  Yeah , I don't understand it . Let 's go  Slide all the way up so we see what the p the p very bottom looks like , or is that it ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Yeah , there 's just one more node and it says \" Mode \" which is the decision between the "}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "OK , great . Alright ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "So basically all I did was I took the last  belief - net"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So  Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "and I grouped things according to what  how I thought they would fit in to uh image schemas that would be related . And the two that I came up with were Trajector - landmark and then Source - path - goal as initial ones ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yep . Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "And then I said well , uh the trajector would be the person in this case probably ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Right , yep ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Um , you know , we have  we have the concept of what their intention was , whether they were trying to tour or do business or whatever ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "or they were hurried . That 's kind of related to that . And then um in terms of the source , the things  uh the only things that we had on there I believe were whether  Oh actually , I kind of ,  I might have added these cuz I don't think we talked too much about the source in the old one but uh whether the  where I 'm currently at is a landmark might have a bearing on whether "}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "or the \" landmark - iness \" of where I 'm currently at .

No , I understand that , but  but um So , what  Let 's slide back up again and see  start at the  at the bottom and Oop - bo - doop - boop - boop . Yeah .

And  and uh  Bhaskara and I was talking about this a little earlier today  is , if we just do this , we could wind up with a huge uh , combinatoric input to the Mode thing .

There  there are a variety of ways of doing it . Uh . Let me just mention something that I don't want to pursue today which is there are technical ways of doing it , uh I I slipped a paper to Bhaskara and  about Noisy - OR 's and Noisy - MAXes and there 're ways to uh sort of back off on the purity of your Bayes - net - edness ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Mmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Uh , so . If you co you could ima and I now I don't know that any of those actually apply in this case , but there is some technology you could try to apply ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "So it 's possible that we could do something like a summary node of some sort that  OK ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah . Yeah . And , um So ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "So in that case , the sum we 'd have  we  I mean , these wouldn't be the summary nodes .

So , if you have some bottom line uh decision about which mode , you know , what are the most relevant things ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Mmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "And the other trick , which is not a technical trick , it 's kind of a knowledge engineering trick , is to make the n  each node sufficiently narrow that you don't get this combinatorics .

So that  that , the  the decision processes are gonna be different What you 'd really like of course is the same thing you 'd always like which is that you have um a kind of intermediate representation which looks the same o over a bunch of inputs and a bunch of outputs . So all sorts of different tasks  and all sorts of different ways of expressing them use a lot of the same mechanism for pulling out what are the fundamental things going on . And that 's  that would be the really pretty result . And pushing it one step further , when you get to construction grammar and stuff , what you 'd like to be able to do is say you have this parser which is much fancier than the parser that comes with uh SmartKom , i that  that actually uses constructions and is able to tell from this construction that there 's uh something about the intent  you know , the actual what people wanna do or what they 're referring to and stuff , in independent of whether it  about  what is this or where is it or something , that you could tell from the construction , you could pull out deep semantic information which you 're gonna use in a general way .

You might be able to  to uh say that this i this is the kind of construction in which the  there 's  Let 's say there 's a uh cont there  the  the land the construction implies the there 's a con this thing is being viewed as a container .

So if you say \" how do I get into the castle \" OK , then um  Or , you know , \" what is there in the castle \" or  so there 's all sorts of things you might ask that involve the castle as a container and you 'd like to have this orthogonal so that anytime the castle 's referred to as a container , you crank up the appropriate stuff .

Exactly ! Exactly ! Alright so ,  a spelling check first then an exhaustive listing of the , uh  all the forms in the data with the punctuation attached and at that point I pick up things like , oh , you know , word followed by two commas . And th and then another check involves , uh , being sure that every utterance has an identifiable speaker . And if not , then that gets checked . Then there 's this issue of glossing s w so - called \" spoken - forms \" . So there  mo for the most part , we 're keeping it standard wo word level transcription . But there 's  w And that that 's done with the assumption that  pronunciation variants can be handled . So for things like \" and \" , the fact that someone doesn't say the \" D \" , uh that 's not important enough to capture in the transcription because a  a good pronunciation , uh , you know , model would be able to handle that . However , things like \" cuz \" where you 're lacking an entire very prominent first syllable , and furthermore , it 's a form that 's specific to spoken language , those are r reasons  f for those reasons I  I kept that separate , and used the convention of using \" CUZ \" for that form , however , glossing it so that it 's possible with the script to plug in the full orthographic form for that one , and a couple of others , not many . So \" wanna \" is another one , \" going  \" uh , \" gonna \" is another one , with just the assumption , again , that this  th these are things which it 's not really fair to a c consider  expect that  a pronunciation model , to handle .

No I know  I know that adjusting those things are gonna  is gonna make it better ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc E", "content": "so I  it 's gonna be a more reliable thing and I 'm not sure "}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "I mean I 'm sure about that ,"}, {"speaker": "Postdoc E", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "but do you have like a time frame when you can expect like all of it to be done , or when you expect them to finish it , or "}, {"speaker": "Postdoc E", "content": "Well partly it depends on how  um , how e effective it will be to apply an algorithm because i this takes time ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc E", "content": "you know , it takes a couple hours t to do , uh , ten minutes ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Yeah , I don't doubt it .

I 'm doing it myself . I mean i if the time markings aren't different across channels , like the channelized version really doesn't have any more information ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "So , I was just  I mean , originally I had done before like the channelized versions were coming out ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Right . Right ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Um ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "So I  I th I think probably the way it 'll go is that , you know , when we make this first general version and then start working on the script , that script @ @ that will be ma you know primarily come from what you 've done , um , we 'll need to work on a channelized version of those originals ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "and so it 's a question of like what  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc E", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "And so it should be pretty much identical to what you have t except for the one that they 've already tightened the boundaries on ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc E", "content": "Yep .

Try  let me just say \" Landmark \" . If the thing is a landmark , you know ,  um  then there 's another thing that says if   um  if it 's closed or not , at the moment . Alright , so you have nodes . Right ? And the , uh , problem that we were having was that , you know , given N - nodes , there 's \" two to the N \" Given N - nodes , and furthermore , the fact that there 's three things here , we need to specify \" three times \" , uh , \" two to the N \" probabilities . Right ? That 's assuming these are all binary , which f they may not be . For example , they could be \" time of day \" , in which case we could , uh , say , you know , \" Morning , afternoon , evening , night \" . So , this could be more So , it 's a lot , anyway . And , that 's a lot of probabilities to put here , which is kind of a pain . So  Noisy - ORs are a way to , uh ,  sort of deal with this . Um Where should I put this ? So , the idea is that , um ,  Let 's call these , uh , C - one , C - two , C - three , and C - four , and E , for Cause and Effect , I guess . The idea is to have these intermediate nodes . Right . Well , actually , the idea , first of all , is that each of these things has a  quote - unquote distinguished state , which means that this is  the state in which we don't really know anything about it . So  right ? So , for example , if we don't really know  if the thing is a landmark or not , Or , i if that just doesn't seem relevant , then that would be th sort of the Disting - the Distinguish state . It 's a really , you know ,  if there is something for the person talking about the admission fee , you know , if they didn't talk about it , that would be the Distinguish state ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "S so , this is a fanciful way of saying \" default \" ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "So  Yeah , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "That 's just what they  the word they used in that paper ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "So , the idea is that , um ,  you have these intermediate nodes , right ? E - one , E - two , E - three and E - four ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So , this is the Heckerman paper you 're working with ? Good ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah . So  The idea is that , each of these EI  is   represents what this would be  if all the other ones were in the distinguish state . Right ? So , for example , suppose that the person  I mean , suppose the thing that they talked about is a landmark . But none of the other   sort of cues really apply . Then ,  this would be  W The  this would just represent the probability distribution of this , assuming that this cue is turned on and the other ones just didn't apply ? So , you know , if it is a landmark , and no none of the other things really ap applicable , then  this would represent the probability distribution . So maybe in this case   Maybe we just t k Maybe we decide that , if the thing 's a landmark and we don't know anything else , then we 're gonna conclude that , um   They want to view it with probability , you know , point four . They want to enter it with probability , uh  with probability point five and they want to approach it probability point one , say  Right ? So we come up with these l little tables for each of those OK . And the final thing is that , um    this is a deterministic function of these , so we don't need to specify any probabilities . We just have to , um , say what function this is , right ? So we can let this be , um   G of E - one comma E - two . E - three , E - four . Right ? and our example G would be , um ,  a majority vote ? Right ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Well . OK , so th so the important point  is  W not what the G function is .

So"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Wha - still sort of leaves one question . It  I mean you  you can always uh  see easily that  that I 'm not grasping everything correctly , but  what seemed attractive to me in im uh in the last discussion we had , was  that we find out a means of  of getting these point four , point five , point one , of C - four , not because , you know , A is a Landmark or not , but we  we  we label this whatever object type , and if it 's a garden , it 's point three , point four , point two . If it 's a castle , it 's point eight , point one , point one . If it 's ,  uh , a town hall , it 's point two , point three , point five ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "And so forth .

So , i is Well , let me say something , guys , cuz there 's not  There 's a pretty point about this we might as well get in right now . Which is  The hierarchy that s comes with the ontology is just what you want for this ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So that   Uh , if you know about it  let 's say , a particular town hall   that , it 's one that is a monument ,  then , that would be stored there . If you don't , you look up the hierarchy , Eh  so , you  you  you may or  So , then you 'd have this little vector of , um , you know , Approach Mode or EVA Mode . Let 's  OK , so we have  the EVA vector for  for various kinds of landmarks . If you know it for a specific landmark you put it there . If you don't , you just go up the hierarchy to the first place you find one ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "OK . So , is the idea to put it in the ontology ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Absolutely ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Uh , or , link to  or  but  but in any case  i View it logically as being in the ontology .

The reason is ,  given the craw bet uh , the  the  the projects that all carry their own taxonomy and , on all history ,  they 're really trying to build one top level ontology ft that covers all the EML projects , and that 's , uh , uh , sort of a tough cookie , a little bit tougher than they  figured .

And , you know , what do we  ? So , um . I mean , this  software that these guys created was certainly a  a key part . So then there 's something central and there aren't at least a bunch of different versions going off in  in ways that  differ  trivially . Uh , um , and , um ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Yeah . That 's  that 's nice ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "and then within that , I guess the idea was to freeze a certain set of options for now , to run it , uh , a particular way , and decide on what things are gonna be experimented with , as opposed to just experimenting with everything . So keep a certain set of things constant . So , um . Uh , maybe describe roughly what  what we are keeping constant for now , or  ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yeah . Well . So we 've been working like six weeks on  on the noise compensation and we end up with something that seems reasonable . Um ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Are you gonna use  which of the two techniques ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "So finally it 's  it 's , um , Wiener filtering on FFT bins . And it uses , uh , two steps , smoothing of the transfer function , the first step , that 's along time , which use recursion . And  after this step there is a further smoothing along frequency , which use a sliding window of twenty FFT bins . Mmm . And , uh "}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "So this is on the  uh , before any mel scaling has been done ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yeah , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "This is "}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "It was "}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "This  this smoothing is done on the estimate , um , of what you 're going to subtract ?

We tried u u applying this on mel bands , having spectral subtraction instead of wiener filtering . Um . Well , finally we end up with  this configuration that works , uh , quite well . So we are going to fix this for the moment and work on the other aspects of  the whole system ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "So "}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Actually , let me int eh , Dave isn't here to talk about it , but let me just interject .

Uh , well you don't  I guess you don't re - synthesize speech , but you could "}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "We  we do not fo"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Uh , but you could ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Well  well , we do , but we don't  don't re - synthesize .

But for the real situation uh , problem is , is that you don't just have reverberation , you have reverberation in noise . And if you don't include that in the model , it doesn't work very well . So in fact it might be a very nice thing to do , to just take the noise removal part of it and put that in front of what he 's looking at . And , uh , generate new files or whatever , and  and , uh , uh  and then do the reverberation part ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So it 's "}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Mmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Anyway ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "So Dave hasn't  tried that yet ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "No , no . He 's  I mean , e"}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "I guess he 's busy with "}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah , prelims , right ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Pre - prelim hell ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Uh , but  but , you know , that 'll  uh , it 's clear that we , uh  we are not  with the real case that we 're looking at , we can't just look at reverberation in isolation because the interaction between that and noise is  is considerable . And that 's I mean , in the past we 've looked at , uh , and this is hard enough , the interaction between channel effects and  and , uh  and additive noise , uh , so convolutional effects and  and additive effects . And that 's hard enough . I mean , I don't think we really  I mean , we 're trying to deal with that . In a sense that 's what we 're trying to deal with in this Aurora task . And we have , uh , the , uh , uh , LDA stuff that in principle is doing something about convolutional effects . And we have the noise suppression that 's doing something about noise . Uh , even that 's hard enough . And  and the on - line normalization as well , in that s category . i i There 's all these interactions between these two and that 's part of why these guys had to work so hard on  on juggling everything around . But now when you throw in the reverberation , it 's even worse , because not only do you have these effects , but you also have some long time effects . And , um , so Dave has something which , uh , is doing some nice things under some conditions with  with long time effects but when it 's  when there 's noise there too , it 's  it 's  it 's pretty hard . So we have to start  Since any  almost any real situation is gonna have  uh , where you have the microphone distant , is going to have both things , we  we actually have to think about both at the same time ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So , um  So there 's this noise suppression thing , which is sort of worked out and then , uh , maybe you should just continue telling what  what else is in the  the form we have ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yeah , well ,  the , um , the other parts of the system are the  the blocks that were already present before and that we did not modify a lot ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So that 's  again , that  that 's the Wiener filtering , followed by , uh  uh , that 's done at the FFT level . Then "}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yeah , th then the mel filter bank ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "then the log operation ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Mmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "The  the  the filtering is done in the frequency domain ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah , OK .

And the input of this neural network would be somewhere between log  mel bands or one of the earlier stages of the processing ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Mm - hmm . So that 's sort of  most of this stuff is  yeah , is operating parallel with this other stuff ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah . So the things that we , um , uh , I guess we sort of  uh , There 's  there 's some , uh , neat ideas for  V A So , I mean , in  I think there 's sort of like  There 's a bunch of tuning things to improve stuff . There 's questions about  various places where there 's an exponent , if it 's the right exponent , or  ways that we 're estimating noise , that we can improve estimating noise . And there 's gonna be a host of those . But structurally it seemed like the things  the main things that  that we brought up that , uh , are  are gonna need to get worked on seriously are , uh , uh , a   a significantly better VAD , uh , putting the neural net on , um , which , you know , we haven't been doing anything with , the , uh , neural net at the end there , and , uh , the , uh ,  opening up the second front .

I would think ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Well , it  it  it  it  so it actually makes it dependent on the overall energy of the  uh , the frame ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "If you do or don't normalize ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "If yo if you don't normalize and  if  if you don't normalize ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Right . Yes , so I mean , one would think that you would want to normalize . But I  I  w w My thought is , uh , particularly if you take the log , try it .

You want to change them one at a time ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So adding this other stream in , that 's simple in some way .

And each one of them has  has a  a nice pattern over time , a one  one second window . And it has  has these patterns . Um , so she has , um a TRAP for each one of the phonemes , um , times fifteen , for each of the fifteen critical bands . And , um ,  she does this agglomerative hierarchical clustering which  which basically , um , is a clustering algorithm that , uh , starts with many , many , many different points  many different clusters  uh , corresponding to the number of data , uh , patterns that you have in the data .

Um , and that 's  that 's constraining your  your clustering to  to the set of phonemes that you already have .

Um , just wondering really ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Um , the sort of standard answer about this sort of thing is that if you 're trying to find  the right system in some sense , whether you 're trying by categories or  or parameters  um , and your goal is discrimination , then having choices based on discrimination as opposed to , um , unsupervised nearness of things , um , is actually better ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Um , and I don't know if that  I mean , since you 're dealing with issues of robustness , you know , maybe  maybe this isn't right , but it 'd be something I 'd be concerned about .

So you have to have some smaller set that you can use , uh , and  and so everybody goes to phonemes . But the problem is that we  we build models of words in terms of phonemes and these models are  are really cartoon - ish , right ?

Um "}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Were you using the  the normalization in addition to this ? I mean , what was the rest of the system ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Um  Yeah . It was  it was , uh , the same system . Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "It was the same system . Mmm . Oh , yeah . A third thing is that , um ,  I play a little bit with the , um   finding what was different between , um , And there were a couple of differences , like the LDA filters were not the same . Um , he had the France Telecom blind equalization in the system . Um , the number o of MFCC that was  were used was different . You used thirteen and we used fifteen . Well , a bunch of differences . And , um , actually the result that he  he got were much better on TI - digits especially . So I 'm kind of investigated to see what was the main factor for this difference . And it seems that the LDA filter is  is  was hurting . Um ,  so when we put s some noise compensation the , um , LDA filter that  that 's derived from noisy speech is not more  anymore optimal . And it makes a big difference , um ,  on TI - digits trained on clean . Uh , if we use the  the old LDA filter , I mean the LDA filter that was in the proposal , we have , like , eighty - two point seven percent recognition rate , um , on noisy speech when the system is trained on clean speech . But  and when we use the filter that 's derived from clean speech we jumped  so from eighty - two point seven to eighty - five point one , which is a huge leap ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Um . Yeah . So now the results are more similar , and I don't  I will not , I think , investigate on the other differences , which is like the number of MFCC that we keep and other small things that we can I think optimize later on anyway ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Sure . But on the other hand if everybody is trying different kinds of noise suppression things and so forth , it might be good to standardize on the piece  that we 're not changing . Right ?

I mean , maybe there 's some deeper reason why it isn't the right thing to do . But , um , at least in principle it looks like there 's  there 's , uh , a couple potential ways to do it . One  one being to just work with the complex numbers , um , and , uh  in rectangular kind of coordinates . And the other is  to , uh , do a Taylor series  Well . So you work with the complex numbers and then when you get the spectrum  the average complex spectrum  um , actually divide it out , um , as opposed to taking the log and subtracting . So then , um , um , you know , there might be some numerical issues . We don't really know that . The other thing we talked a little bit about was Taylor series expansion . And , um , uh , actually I was talking to Dick Karp about it a little bit , and  and  and , since I got thinking about it , and  and , uh , so one thing is that y you 'd have to do , I think , uh  we may have to do this on a whiteboard , but I think you have to be a little careful about scaling the numbers that you 're  taking  the complex numbers that you 're taking the log of because  the Taylor expansion for it has , you know , a square and a cube , and  and so forth . And  and so if   if you have a  a number that is modulus , you know , uh , very different from one   It should be right around one , if it 's  cuz it 's a expansion of log one  one minus epsilon or o is  is  one plus epsilon , or is it one plus  ? Well , there 's an epsilon squared over two and an epsilon cubed over three ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad G", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "and so forth .

You can specify  the minimum length of speech or  and silence portions which you want .

Yeah ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Yep . Sure . Go ahead ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "And so so  so for instance if you d if you a if you add the noise that normally masks  masks the uh  the  the signal right ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "and you can show that in  that if the  if you add the noise outside the critical band , that doesn't affect the  the decisions you 're making about a signal within a critical band ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Unless this noise is modulated .

So , I don"}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Yeah . But you should always look at insertions , deletions , and substitutions ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Yeah . Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "So "}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "so , uh  MSG is very , very dif Eh , PLP is very much like mel cepstrum . MSG is very different from both of them ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "So , if it 's very different , then this is the sort of thing  I mean I 'm really glad Andreas brought this point up . I  sort of had forgotten to discuss it . Um . You always have to look at how this  uh , these adjustments , uh , affect things . And even though we 're not allowed to do that , again we maybe could reflect that back to our use of the features ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "So if it  if in fact , uh  The problem might be that the range of the MSG features is quite different than the range of the PLP or mel cepstrum ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "And you might wanna change that ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "But  Yeah . But , it 's d it 's after  Well , it 's tandem features , so  Mmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Yeah . We  we have estimation of post posteriors with PLP and with MSG as input ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "so I don Well . I don't know ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "That means they 're between zero and one ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "But i it  it  it  it doesn't necessarily  You know , they could be , um  Do - doesn't tell you what the variance of the things is ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Mmm . Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Right ? Cuz if you 're taking the log of these things , it could be , uh  Knowing what the sum of the probabilities are , doesn't tell you what the sum of the logs are ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Mm - hmm . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "So ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Yeah . So we should look at the likelihood , or  or what ? Or  well , at the log , perhaps , and "}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Or what  you know , what you 're uh  the thing you 're actually looking at ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "So your  your  the values that are  are actually being fed into HTK ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Mm - hmm . But "}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "What do they look like ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "No And so th the , uh  for the tandem system , the values that come out of the net don't go through the sigmoid . Right ? They 're sort of the pre - nonlinearity values ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Yes ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Right . So they 're  kinda like log probabilities is what I was saying ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "And those  OK . And tho that 's what goes  into  HTK ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Uh , almost . But then you actually do a KLT on them ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Um . They aren't normalized after that , are they ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Mmm . No , they are not  no ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "No . OK . So , um . Right . So the question is  Yeah . Whatever they are at that point , um , are they something for which taking a square root or cube root or fourth root or something like that is  is gonna be a good or a bad thing ? So ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Uh , and that 's something that nothing  nothing else after that is gonna  Uh , things are gonna scale it  Uh , you know , subtract things from it , scale it from it , but nothing will have that same effect . Um . So . Um . Anyway , eh "}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Yeah . Cuz if  if the log probs that are coming out of the MSG are really big , the standard  insertion penalty is gonna have very little effect"}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Well , the  Right ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "compared to , you know , a smaller set of log probs ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Yeah . No . Again you don't really  look at that . It 's something  that , and then it 's going through this transformation that 's probably pretty close to  It 's , eh , whatever the KLT is doing . But it 's probably pretty close to what a  a  a discrete cosine transformation is doing ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "But still it 's  it 's not gonna probably radically change the scale of things . I would think . And , uh  Yeah . It may be entirely off and  and it may be  at the very least it may be quite different for MSG than it is for mel cepstrum or PLP . So that would be  So the first thing I 'd look at without adjusting anything would just be to go back to the experiment and look at the , uh , substitutions , insertions , and deletions . And if the  if the , uh  i if there 's a fairly large effect of the difference , say , uh , uh , the r ratio between insertions and deletions for the two cases then that would be , uh , an indicator that it might  might be in that direction ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah . But ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Anything else ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "my  my point was more that it  it works sometimes and  but sometimes it doesn't work ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "So ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Well ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "And it works on TI - digits and on SpeechDat - Car it doesn't work , and "}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Mm - hmm . Yeah . Well ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "But , you know , some problems are harder than others ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Mm - hmm . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "and  And , uh , sometimes , you know , there 's enough evidence for something to work and then it 's harder , it breaks . You know ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "so it 's  But it  but , um , i it  it could be that when you say it works maybe we could be doing much better , even in TI - digits . Right ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Yeah . Yeah , sure ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "So ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Uh ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Hmm ? Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Yeah . Well , there is also the spectral subtraction , which , um  I think maybe we should , uh , try to integrate it in  in our system ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Mmm . Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "But ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "O"}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "I think that would involve to   to mmm  use a big  a  al already a big bunch of the system of Ericsson .

A sudden change or a relatively rapid change in some spectral characteristic will  will do sort of this . I mean , there 's certainly a bunch of  a bunch of places where you know that neurons are gonna fire because something novel has happened . That was  that was the main thing that we were focusing on there .

You know , you look at the phone and you say this phone is supposed to be  you know , have this feature , this feature , and this feature .

Here 's some event ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "What  ?

See how  how  how good they are , um , in , um  in terms of phoneme recognition or word recognition . And , um  and then from that point on , I would , uh , s design robust event detectors , um , in a similar , um , wa spirit that Saul has done w uh , with his graphical models , and this  this probabilistic AND - OR model that he uses . Um , eh , try to extend it to , um  to account for other  other phenomena like , um , CMR co - modulation release . And , um  and maybe also investigate ways to  to modify the structure of these models , um , in a data - driven way , uh , similar to the way that , uh , Jeff  Jeff , uh , Bilmes did his work . Um , and while I 'm  I 'm doing these , um , event detectors , you know , I can ma mea measure my progress by comparing , um , the error rates in clean and noisy conditions to something like , uh , neural nets . Um , and  So  so , once we have these  these , uh , event detectors , um , we could put them together and  and feed the outputs of the event detectors into  into the SRI , um , HMM  HMM system , and , um  and test it on  on Switchboard or , um , maybe even Aurora stuff .

OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad H", "content": "And then I median - filtered that  using , um  a fairly long  filter length .

I certainly could though . But this was just I had the program mostly written already so it was easy to do . OK and then the other thing I did , was I took  Javier 's speaker - change detector  acoustic - change detector , and I implemented that with the close - talking mikes , and  unfortunately that 's not working real well , and it looks like it 's  the problem is  he does it in two passes , the first pass  is to find candidate places to do a break . And he does that using a neural net doing broad phone classification and he has the  the , uh  one of the phone classes is silence . And so the possible breaks are where silence starts and ends . And then he has a second pass which is a modeling  a Gaussian mixture model . Um looking for  uh  whether it improves or  or degrades to split at one of those particular places .

But , like , it could be someone who isn't the person here , but the person over there or it can be the person breathing . And then feeding that into the acoustic change detector .

So , for the thing that "}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "That 's good ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "We need to give Brian the beeps file ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "so I was gonna probably put it "}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "We can put it in the same place . Just put in another directory ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah , it I 'll make another directory ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "Well , make ano make another directory ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah . Exactly ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "You don't n m"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "And , Andreas , um , sampled ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "Yeah . They are ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "I think so . Yeah . Um , so either we should regenerate the original  versions , {comment}  or um , we should just make a note of it ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "OK . Oh . Beca - Well  OK , because in one directory there 's two versions ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Yeah , that 's the first meeting I cut both versions . Just to check which w if there is a significant difference ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "OK . And so I  but  OK so  but for the other meetings it 's the downsampled version that you have ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "They 're all downsampled , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "Oh , OK . Oh that 's th important to know , OK so we should probably  uh  give them the non - downsampled versions ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Yeah . So "}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "OK . Alright , then I 'll hold off on that and I 'll wait for you um "}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Probably by tomorrow"}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "gen"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "I can  I 'll send you an email ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "OK . Alright . OK . Yeah , definitely they should have the full bandwidth version ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Yeah , because I mean  I I think Liz decided to go ahead with the  downsampled versions cuz we can  There was no s like , r significant difference ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "yeah . OK . Well , it takes  it takes up less disk space , for one thing ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "It does take up less disk space , and apparently it did even better  than the original  than the original versions ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "Yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "which you know , is just , probably random ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "Right . Yeah , it was a small difference"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "But , um  they probably w want the originals ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "but yeah . Yeah . OK . OK , good . Good that  Well , it 's a good thing that "}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "OK , I think we 're losing , Don and Andreas at three - thirty , right ? OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Hey mon hafta booga ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "So , that 's why it was good to have Andreas , say these things but  So , we should probably talk about the IBM transcription process stuff that "}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "OK . So , um you know that Adam created um , a b a script to generate the beep file ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "To then create something to send to IBM . And , um , you  you should probably talk about that . But  but you were gonna to use the  originally transcribed file because I tightened the time bins and that 's also the one that they had already  in trying to debug the first stage of this . And uh , my understanding was that , um  I haven't   I haven't listened to it yet ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "but it sounded very good and  and I understand that you guys  were going to have a meeting today , before this meeting ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "It was just to talk about how to generate it . Um , just so that while I 'm gone , you can regenerate it if you decide to do it a different way . So uh , Chuck and Thilo should , now more or less know how to generate the file"}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "Excellent . OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "and ,  the other thing Chuck pointed out is that , um ,  since this one is hand - marked ,  there are discourse boundaries . Right ? So  so when one person is speaking , there 's breaks ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Whereas Thilo 's won't have that . So what  what we 're probably gonna do is just write a script , that if two , chunks are very close to each other on the same channel we 'll just merge them ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "Oh ! OK . Ah , interesting . Yeah . Yeah . Oh , sure . Yeah , sure . Makes sense ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "So , uh , and that will get around the problem of , the ,  you know \" one word beep , one word beep , one word beep , one word beep \" ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "Yeah . Ah ! Clever . Yes . Clever . Yeah . Excellent ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah , in fact after our meeting uh , this morning Thilo came in and said that  um , there could be  other differences between  the uh  already transcribed meeting with the beeps in it and one that has  just r been run through his process ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "And that 's the purpose . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "So tomorrow ,  when we go to make the um  uh , chunked file  for IBM , we 're going to actually compare the two . So he 's gonna run his process on that same meeting ,"}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "Great idea !"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "and then we 're gonna do the beep - ify on both , and listen to them and see if we notice any real differences ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "Beep - ify !"}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "OK , now one thing that prevented us from apply you  you from applying  Exactly . The training  So that is the training meeting . OK ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah , w and we know that . Wel - uh we just wanna if  if there 're any major differences between  doing it on the hand"}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "Uh - huh . Oh , interesting . Ah !"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "OK . Interesting idea . Great ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "So this training meeting , uh w un is that uh  some data where we have uh very um ,  you know , accurate  time marks ? for "}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "I went back and hand - marked the  ba the bins , I ment I mentioned that last week ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "OK , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "But the  but there 's  yeah , but there is this one issue with them in that there 're   there are time boundaries in there that occur in the middle of speech ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "Because "}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "So  Like when we went t to um  When I was listening to the original file that Adam had , it 's like you  you hear a word then you hear a beep  and then you hear the continuation of what is the same sentence ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "That 's on the other channel . That 's because of channel overlap ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Well , and  and so the  th"}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "It 's  i"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "So there are these chunks that look like uh   that have uh "}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "I mean that 's not gonna be true of the foreground speaker . That 'll only be if it 's the background speaker ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Right . So you 'll  you 'll have a chunk of , you know , channel  A which starts at zero and ends at ten , and then the same channel starting at eleven , ending at fifteen , and then again , starting at sixteen , ending at twenty . Right , so that 's three chunks where  actually we w can just make one chunk out of that which is A , zero , twenty ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "That 's what I just said ,"}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "Sure . Sure ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah . So I just wanted to make sure that it was clear ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "Yeah , I thought that was "}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "So  if you were to use these , you have to be careful not to pull out these individual "}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "Oh ! I mean it  Right , I mean w I mean what I would  I was interested in is having   a se having time marks for the beginnings and ends of speech by each speaker ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Well , that 's definitely a problem ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "Uh , because we could use that to fine tune our alignment process"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Battery ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "to make it more accurate ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Battery ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "So  uh , it  I don't care that you know , there 's actually abutting segments that we have to join together . That 's fine ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "But what we do care about is that  the beginnings and ends um  are actually close to the speech  inside of that"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah , I think Jane tightened these up by hand ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "uh "}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "OK , so what is the  sort of how tight are they ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Uh , it looks much better ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Yeah . Looks good ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "They were , um , reasonably tight , but not excruciatingly tight ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "Oh ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "That would 've taken more time .

That 's fine ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "So , that means that  the amount of time after something is variable depending partly on context , but my general goal  when there was  sufficient space , room , pause  after it  to have it be  kind of a natural feeling  gap ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "Which I c I don't know what it would be quantified as .

Well ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "but "}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "that 's  that 's right , but you know , thi this brings me to the other f stage of this which I discussed with you earlier today ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "which is  the second stage is  um , w what to do  in terms of the transcribers adjustment of these data . I discussed this with you too . Um , the tr so the idea initially was , we would get  uh , for the new meetings , so the e EDU meetings , that  Thilo ha has now presegmented all of them for us , on a channel by channel basis . And um , so , I 've assigned  I 've  I 've assigned them to our transcribers and um , so far I 've discussed it with one , with uh  And I had a  about an hour discussion with her about this yesterday , we went through  uh EDU - one , at some extent . And it occurred to me that  um  that  basically what we have in this kind of a format is  you could consider it as a staggered mixed file , we had some discussion over the weekend a about  at  at this other meeting that we were all a at  um ,  about whether the tran the IBM transcribers should hear a single channel audio , or a mixed channel audio . And um ,  in  in a way , by  by having this  this chunk and then the backchannel  after it , it 's like a stagal staggered mixed channel . And um ,  it occurred  to me in my discussion with her yesterday that um , um , the   the  the maximal gain , it 's  from the IBM  people , may be in long stretches of connected speech . So it 's basically a whole bunch of words  which they can really do , because of the continuity within that person 's turn . So , what I 'm thinking , and it may be that not all meetings will be good for this , {comment} but  but what I 'm thinking is that  in the EDU meetings , they tend to be  driven by a couple of dominant speakers . And , if the chunked files focused on the dominant speakers ,  then , when  when it got s patched together when it comes back from IBM , we can add the backchannels . It seems to me  that  um , you know , the backchannels per - se wouldn't be so hard , but then there 's this question of the time  @ @ {comment} uh , marking , and whether the beeps would be  uh y y y And I 'm not exactly sure how that  how that would work with the  with the backchannels . And , so um  And certainly things that are  intrusions of multiple words ,  taken out of context and displaced in time from where they occurred ,  that would be hard . So , m my  thought is  i I 'm having this transcriber go through  the EDU - one meeting , and indicate a start time  f for each dominant speaker , endpoi end time for each dominant speaker , and the idea that  these units would be generated for the dominant speakers ,  and maybe not for the other channels ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Yeah the only , um , disadvantage of that is , then it 's hard to use an automatic method to do that . The advantage is that it 's probably faster to do that than it is to use the automated method and correct it . So ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "Well , it "}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "We 'll just have to see ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "OK . I think   I  I think um , you know , the original plan was that the transcriber would adjust the t the boundaries , and all that for all the channels but ,  you know , that is so time - consuming , and since we have a bottleneck here , we want to get IBM things that are usable s as soon as possible , then this seemed to me it 'd be a way of gett to get them a flood of data , which would be useful when it comes back to us .

And in the other  in the other case , if it 's marked as speech ,  and really there 's nothing transcribable in it , then she 's going to put a s dash , and I 'll go through and it  and um , you know , with a    with a substitution command , get it so that it 's clear that those are the other category . I 'll just , you know , recode them . But um ,  um , the transcribable events  that um , I 'm considering in this ,  uh , continue to be  laugh , as well as speech , and cough and things like that , so I 'm not stripping out anything , just  just you know , being very lenient in what 's considered speech .

So  there 's all the problems that the linguists know about , about mental spaces , and the cognitive linguists know about , but then there 's this problem of the belief - net people have only done a moderately good job of dealing with temporal belief - nets .

So the story is that if you have these probabilistic relational models , they 're set up , in principle , so that you can make new instances and instances connect to each other , and all that sort of stuff , so it should be feasible to set them up in such a way that if you 've got the past tense and the present tense and each of those is a separate  uh , belief structure that they do their inferences with just the couplings that are appropriate . But that 's g that 's , as far as I can tell , it 's  it 's putting together two real hard problems . One is the linguistic part of what are the couplings and  and when you have a certain , uh , construction , that implies certain couplings and other couplings , you know , between let 's say between the past and the present , or any other one of these things and then we have this inference problem of exactly technically how does the belief - net work if it 's got um , let 's say one in  in , you know , different tenses or my beliefs and your beliefs , or any of these other ones of  of multiple models . So um you know , in the long run we need to solve both of those and my suggestion is that we start digging into them both , uh , in a way we that , you know , th hopefully turns out to be consistent , so that the  Um .

The ontology will tell us that castles have opening hours , that they have admission fees , they have whatever . And then , this is  We go via a thesaurus and look up  certain linguistic surface structures  that are related to these concepts and feed those through the dialogue history and check dynamically for each e entity .

Yeah it  it 's not that surprising ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "But to me it just  it just meant a practical  point that um if we want to  publish results on digits that  that people pay  attention to we probably should uh  Cuz we 've had the problem before that you get  show some  nice improvement on something that 's  that 's uh , uh  it seems like too large a number , and uh  uh people don't necessarily take it so seriously ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Um .

Yeah and again , you know , i that 's true either way . I mean so take a look at the uh   um , the SRI results .

I don't think uh  I mean , I 'm sure they wouldn't release the numbers , but I don't think that uh  the uh  the  the companies that  that do telephone  speech get anything like point four percent on their  digits .

I know Thilo and Dan Ellis are  are submitting something , but uh ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Yeah . I   I guess e the only thing with these  the Meeting Recorder and , well ,  So , I think , yeah  I think we basically gave up ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Um .  Now , actually for the  for the Aur - uh"}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "But "}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "we do have stuff for Aurora , right ?

Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "and we have   We don't  we don't have to flood it with papers . We 're not trying to prove anything to anybody . so . That 's fine . Um . Anything else ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Yeah . Well . So . Perhaps the point is that we 've been working on  is , yeah , we have put the um the good VAD in the system and  it really makes a huge difference . Um . So , yeah .

So there is this point . Uh . The problem is that it 's very big and   we still have to think how to  where to put it and   um ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "because it  it  well , this VAD uh either some delay and we  if we put it on the server side , it doesn't work , because on the server side features you already have LDA applied  from the f from the terminal side and  so you accumulate the delay so the VAD should be before the LDA which means perhaps on the terminal side and then smaller  and"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "So wha where did this good VAD come from ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "So . It 's um from OGI . So it 's the network trained  it 's the network with the huge amounts on hidden  of hidden units , and um nine input frames compared to the VAD that was in the proposal which has a very small amount of hidden units and fewer inputs ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "This is the one they had originally ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Oh . Yeah , but they had to  get rid of it because of the space , didn't they ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Yeah . So . Yeah . But the abso assumption is that we will be able to make a VAD that 's small and that works fine . And . So we can "}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Well . So that 's a problem . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Yeah but  nnn ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "But the other thing is uh to use a different VAD entirely . I mean , uh i if  if there 's a  if  if  I  I don't know what the thinking was amongst the  the  the  the ETSI folk but um if everybody agreed sure let 's use this VAD and take that out of there "}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . They just want , apparently  they don't want to fix the VAD because they think there is some interaction between feature extraction and  and VAD or frame dropping But they still  want to  just to give some um  requirement for this VAD because it 's  it will not be part of  they don't want it to be part of the standard ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "So . So it must be at least uh somewhat fixed but not completely .

So there is this thing . There is um  Yeah . Uh I designed a new  a new filter because when I designed other filters with shorter delay from the LDA filters ,  there was one filter with fif sixty millisecond delay and the other with ten milliseconds"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "and  uh Hynek suggested that both could have sixty - five sixty - s I think it 's sixty - five ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Yeah . Both should have sixty - five because "}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "You didn't gain anything , right ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Yeah . And .

I think "}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "So that means logically , in principle , it should be better .

And um so I 've been looking at Avendano 's work and um uh I 'll try to write up in my next stat status report a nice description of  what he 's doing , but it 's  it 's an approach to deal with  reverberation or that  the aspect of his work that I 'm interested in the idea is that um    normally an analysis frames are um  too short to encompass reverberation effects um in full . You miss most of the reverberation tail in a ten millisecond window and so   you  you 'd like it to be that  um  the reverberation responses um simply convolved um in , but it 's not really with these ten millisecond frames cuz you j But if you take , say , a two millisecond  um window  I 'm sorry a two second window then in a room like this , most of the reverberation response  is included in the window and the  then it um  then things are l more linear . It is  it is more like the reverberation response is simply c convolved and um   and you can use channel normalization techniques  like uh in his thesis he 's assuming that the reverberation response is fixed . He just does um  mean subtraction , which is like removing the DC component of the modulation spectrum and  that 's supposed to d um deal  uh deal pretty well with the um reverberation and um  the neat thing is you can't take these two second frames and feed them to a speech recognizer um  so he does this  um  method training trading the um  the spectral resolution for time resolution  and um  come ca uh synthesizes a new representation which is with say ten second frames but a lower s um  frequency resolution . So I don't really know the theory . I guess it 's  these are called \" time frequency representations \" and h he 's making the  the time sh um finer grained and the frequency resolution um less fine grained ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "s so I 'm  I guess my first stab actually in continuing  his work is to um  re - implement this  this thing which um  changes the time and frequency resolutions cuz he doesn't have code for me .

I don't really know the theory ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Oh , and um ,  another f first step is um , so the  the way I want to extend his work is make it able to deal with a time varying reverberation response um  and um we don't really know  how fast the um  the reverberation response is varying the Meeting Recorder data um so um  we  we have this um block least squares um imp echo canceller implementation and um  I want to try  finding  the  the response , say , between a near mike and the table mike for someone using the echo canceller and looking at the echo canceller taps and then  see how fast that varies  from block to block ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "That should give an idea of how fast the reverberation response is changing ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "OK .

So there is the tandem network that e e e estimates the phone probabilities"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "and the silence probabilities also ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "And  things get better when , instead of using the silence probability computed by the tandem network , we use the silence probability , uh , given by the VAD network ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Oh ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "um ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "The VAD network is  ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Which is smaller , but maybe , um  So we have a network for the VAD which has one hundred hidden units , and the tandem network has five hundred . Um . So it 's smaller but th the silence probability  from this network seems , uh , better ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Mmm . Uh . Well , it looks strange , but "}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah . But "}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "but it"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Maybe it 's  has something to do to  the fact that  we don't have infinite training data and "}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "We don't ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Well ! And so  Well , things are not optimal"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "and  Mmm "}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Are you  you were going to say why  what made you  wh what led you to do that ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah . Uh , there was a p {comment} problem that we observed , um ,   that there was  there were , like , many insertions in the  in the system ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Mmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Actually plugging in the tandem network was increasing , I  I  I think , the number of insertions ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "And ,  um  So it looked strange and then just using the  the other silence probability helps . Mmm . Um  Yeah . The next thing we will do is train this tandem on more data ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So , you know , in a way what it might  i it 's  it 's a little bit like  combining knowledge sources ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Um "}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Right ? Because  the fact that you have these two nets that are different sizes  means they behave a little differently ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "they find different  things . And , um , if you have , um  f the distribution that you have from , uh , f speech sounds is w {comment} sort of one source of knowledge ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "And this is  and rather than just taking one minus that to get the other , which is essentially what 's happening , you have this other source of knowledge that you 're putting in there .

Maybe it 's better ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Anyway , you can probably justify anything if what 's use"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "And  and the features are different also .

Uh . Well , there are other things that  we should do but ,  um ,  it requires time and   We have ideas , like  so , these things are like hav having a better VAD . Uh , we have some ideas about that . It would   probably implies working a little bit on features that are more  suited to a voice activity detection ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Working on the second stream . Of course we have ideas on this also , but   w we need to try different things and  Uh , but their noise estimation , um   uh "}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "I mean , back on the second stream , I mean , that 's something we 've talked about for a while . I mean , I think  that 's certainly a high hope ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah .  Mmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Um , so we have this  this default idea about just using some sort of purely spectral thing ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Uh , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "for a second stream ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "But , um , we  we did a first try with this , and it  it  clearly hurts ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "But , uh , how was the stream combined ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Uh .  It was c it was just combined , um , by the acoustic model . So there was , no neural network for the moment ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Right . So , I mean , if you just had a second stream that was just spectral and had another neural net and combined there , that  that , uh ,  might be good ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Mm - hmm . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mmm . Yeah . Um  Yeah , and the other thing , that noise estimation and th um , maybe try to train  uh , the training data for the t tandem network , right now , is like  i is using the noises from the Aurora task and   I think that people might ,  um , try to argue about that because  then in some cases we have the same noises in  for training the network  than the noises that are used for testing ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "and  So we have t n uh , to try to get rid of these   this problem ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah . Maybe you just put in some other noise , something that 's different ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Mm - hmm .  Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "I mean , it  it 's probably helpful to have  have a little noise there .

That 's a good idea ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Um . Yeah . The last thing is that I think we are getting close to human performance . Well , that 's something I would like to investigate further , but , um , I did , like , um  I did , uh , listen to the m most noisy utterances of the SpeechDat - Car Italian and tried to transcribe them .

I mean  I mean , so  so the first is  that by doing LPC - twelve with synthesized speech w like you 're saying , uh , it 's   i i you 're  you 're adding other degradation ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Uh - huh ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Right ? So it 's not just the noise but you 're adding in fact some degradation because it 's only an approximation . Um , and the second thing is  which is m maybe more interesting  is that , um , {comment}  if you do it with whispered speech , you get this number . What if you had  done analysis {comment} re - synthesis and taken the pitch as well ? Alright ? So now you put the pitch in ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Uh - huh ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "What would the percentage be then ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Um "}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "See , that 's the question .

Um ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Uh , yeah . But "}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "if i on the other hand , if it stayed up  near five percent ,  then I 'd say \" boy , LPC n twelve is pretty crummy \" . You know ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Uh - huh ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So I I I 'm not sure  I 'm not sure how we can conclude from this anything about  that our system is close to  the human performance ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Ye Yeah . Well , the point is that eh l ey  the point is that , um ,  what I  what I listened to when I re - synthesized the LP - the LPC - twelve  spectrum  is in a way what the system , uh , is hearing , cuz @ @  all the  all the , um , excitation  all the  well , the excitation is  is not taken into account . That 's what we do with our system .

Right ? I mean , th the thing is LPC is not a  a really great representation of speech ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So , all I 'm saying is that you have in addition to the w the , uh , removal of pitch ,  you also are doing , uh , a particular parameterization ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "which , um , uh "}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Mmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Uh , so , let 's see , how would you do  ?

Actually , we d we  we don't , because we do  we do , uh ,  uh , mel filter bank , for instance . Right ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah , but is it that  is it that different , I mean ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Um ,  I don't know what mel ,  uh , based synthesis would sound like ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "I"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "but certainly the spectra are quite different ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Couldn't you t couldn't you , um , test the human performance on just the original  audio ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Mm - hmm .

Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "I mean  We were  we were j It  it  it 's a little bit still apples and oranges because we are choosing these features in order to be the best for recognition ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Uh - huh ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "And , um , i if you listen to them they still might not be very  Even if you made something closer to what we 're gonna  i it might not sound very good ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Uh , and i the degradation from that might  might actually make it even harder ,  uh , to understand than the LPC - twelve .

So , you just extract it from the actual speech and put it back in , and see does that  is that  does that make the difference ? If that  if that takes it down to one percent again ,  then you 'd say \" OK , it 's  it 's in fact having , um ,  not just the spectral envelope but also the  also the  the pitch  that , uh , {comment} @ @ {comment} has the information that people can use , anyway . \""}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Uh - huh . Mmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "But from this it 's pretty safe to say that the system is with either  two to seven percent away from  the performance of a human . Right ?

I do don't wanna take you away from other things ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "But  {comment} but "}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "But that 's   that 's what  that 's the first thing that I would be curious about , is , you know , i i  when you we"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "But the signal itself is like a mix of  um , of a  a periodic sound and ,  @ @ {comment} uh , unvoiced sound , and the noise"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "which is mostly ,  uh , noise .

Uh - huh . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah . I mean , it 's probably not worth your time .

Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "And then that would tell you whether in fact it 's  Cuz we 've talked about , like , this harmonic tunneling or  other things that people have done based on pitch , maybe that 's really a key element .

Suppose y you can't adjust  these word insertion penalties and so forth , so you have to do everything at the level of the features . What could you do ?

But , uh , uh , {comment} uh , n not  not so much in this meeting about Aurora , but  but , uh , uh , maybe just , uh , quickly today about  maybe you could just say a little bit about what you 've been talking about with Michael . And  and then Barry can say something about  what {comment}  what we 're talking about ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "OK . So Michael Kleinschmidt , who 's a PHD student from Germany ,  showed up this week . He 'll be here for about six months . And he 's done some work using  an auditory model  of , um ,  human hearing , and  using that f uh , to generate speech recognition features . And  he did  work back in Germany  with , um , a toy recognition system  using , um , isolated  digit recognition  as the task . It was actually just a single - layer neural network  that classified words  classified digits ,  in fact . Um , and  he tried that on  I think on some Aurora data and got results that he thought  seemed respectable . And he w he 's coming here to u u use it on a  uh , a real speech recognition system . So I 'll be working with him on that . And , um , maybe I should say a little more about these features , although I don't understand them that well . The  I think it 's a two - stage idea . And , um ,  the first stage of these features correspond to what 's called the peripheral  auditory system . And  I guess that is like  a filter bank with a compressive nonlinearity . And  I 'm - I 'm not sure what we have @ @ in there that isn't already modeled in something like ,  um ,  PLP . I should learn more about that . And then  the second stage  is , um ,  the most different thing , I think , from what we usually do . It 's , um    it computes features which are ,  um ,  based on  sort of like based on diffe different w um , wavelet basis functions  used to analyze  the input .  So th he uses analysis functions called  Gabor functions , um ,  which have a certain  extent , um ,  in time and in frequency . And  the idea is these are used to sample ,  um , the signal in a represented as a time - frequency representation . So you 're  sampling some piece of this time - frequency plane . And , um ,  that ,  um , is  is interesting , cuz ,  @ @ for  for one thing , you could use it ,  um , in a  a multi - scale way . You could have these  instead of having everything  like we use a twenty - five millisecond or so analysis window ,  typically , um , and that 's our time scale for features , but you could   using this , um , basis function idea , you could have some basis functions which have a lot longer time scale and , um , some which have a lot shorter , and  so it would be like  a set of multi - scale features . So he 's interested in , um  Th - this is  because it 's , um  there are these different parameters for the shape of these  basis functions ,  um   there are a lot of different possible basis functions . And so he   he actually does  an optimization procedure to choose an   an optimal set of basis functions out of all the possible ones ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Hmm . H What does he do to choose those ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "The method he uses is kind of funny  is , {comment}  um ,  he starts with  he has a set of M of them . Um , he  and then  he uses that to classify  I mean , he t he tries , um ,  using  just M minus one of them . So there are M possible subsets of this  length - M vector . He tries classifying , using each of the M  possible sub - vectors ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Whichever sub - vector ,  um , works the  the best , I guess , he says   the  the fe feature that didn't use was the most useless feature ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Y yeah . Gets thrown out . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "so we 'll throw it out and we 're gonna randomly select another feature  from the set of possible basis functions ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Hmm !"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "So it 's a "}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So i so it 's actuall"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "it 's a little bit like a genetic algorithm or something in a way ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Well , it 's  it 's much simpler ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "It 's like a greedy "}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "But it 's  but it 's  uh , it 's  there 's a lot  number of things I like about it , let me just say ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Greedy ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So , first thing , well , you 're absolutely right . I mean ,  i i  in truth ,  both pieces of this are  have their analogies in stuff we already do . But it 's a different take  at how to approach it and potentially one that 's m maybe a bit more systematic than what we 've done , uh , and a b a bit more inspiration from  from auditory things . So it 's  so I think it 's a neat thing to try . The primary features ,  um , are in fact  Yeah , essentially , it 's  it 's , uh , you know , PLP or  or mel cepstrum , or something like that . You 've  you 've got some ,  uh , compression . We always have some compression . We always have some  you know , the  the  the kind of filter bank with a kind of   quasi - log scaling . Um ,  if you put in  if you also include the RASTA in it  i RASTA  the filtering being done in the log domain  has an AGC - like , uh , characteristic , which , you know , people typi typically put in these kind of ,  uh ,  um ,  uh , auditory front - ends . So it 's very , very similar , uh , but it 's not exactly the same . Um , I would agree that the second one is  is somewhat more different but ,  um , it 's mainly different in that the things that we have been doing like that have been   um , had a different kind of motivation and have ended up with different kinds of constraints . So , for instance , if you look at the LDA RASTA stuff ,  you know , basically what they do is they  they look at the different eigenvectors out of the LDA and they form filters out of it . Right ? And those  filters have different , uh , kinds of temporal extents and temporal characteristics . And so in fact they 're multi - scale . But , they 're not sort of systematically multi - scale , like \" let 's start here and go to there , and go to there , and go to there \" , and so forth . It 's more like ,  you run it on this , you do discriminant analysis , and you find out what 's helpful . "}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "I it 's multi - scale because you use several of these in parallel ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah . They use several of them ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "is that right ? Of "}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Uh , I mean , you don't have to but  but  but , uh , Hynek has . Um , but it 's also , uh   Hyn - when Hynek 's had people do this kind of LDA analysis , they 've done it on frequency direction and they 've done it on the time direction . I think he may have had people sometimes doing it on both simultaneously  some two - D  and that would be the closest to these Gabor function kind of things . Uh , but I don't think they 've done that much of that . And , uh , the other thing that 's interesting  the  the , uh  the feature selection thing , it 's a simple method , but I kinda like it . Um ,  there 's a   a old , old method for feature selection . I mean ,  eh , uh , I remember people referring to it as old when I was playing with it twenty years ago , so I know it 's pretty old , uh , called Stepwise Linear Discriminant Analysis in which you  which  I think it 's used in social sciences a lot . So , you  you  you  you pick the best feature . And then  you take  y you find the next feature that 's the best in combination with it . And then so on and so on . And what  what Michael 's describing seems to me much , much better , because the problem with the stepwise discriminant analysis is that you don't know that  you know , if you 've  picked the right set of features . Just because something 's a good feature doesn't mean that you should be adding it . So ,  um ,  uh , here at least you 're starting off with all of them , and you 're  throwing out useless features . I think that 's  that seems , uh   that seems like a lot better idea . Uh , you 're always looking at things in combination with other features .

And in the first round they do  uh , I think it 's three iterations , and for the last three rounds e e they do seven iterations of re - estimation in each of those three .

There 's  there 's four and there 's seven and  I  I 'm sorry ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah . Uh , maybe I should write it on the board . So ,  there 's four rounds of training . Um , I g I g I guess you could say iterations . The first one is three , then seven , seven , and seven .

The mean subtraction approach for SRI that relied on a twelve second interval resulted in a zero point three percent improvement over the six second model, not necessarily significant. The team thought that training the model on different speeds of speech would be helpful to add to this progress. Grad A introduced the team to her formal proposal for the qualifier exam. The work focused on intermediate classifiers and multi-band graphical models for speech recognition. The team then discussed noise removal as well The model PhD B was working on did not do well in non-stationary noise environments. In general, however, the model had improved. The VAD was labeling speech as silence segments, which could be attributed to alignment issues.

The speaker suggested that this could be due to lower mean energy in Finnish and that the noise addition should be lower.

Um , d and , um , ap ap apart from that , I guess the  the main thing I have t ta I have to talk is , um , where I 'm planning to go over the next week . Um . So I 've been working on integrating this mean subtraction approach into the SmartKom system . And there 's this question of , well , so , um , in my tests before with HTK I found it worked  it worked the best with about twelve seconds of data used to estimate the mean , but , we 'll often have less {comment} in the SmartKom system . Um . So I think we 'll use as much data as we have  at a particular time , and we 'll   we 'll concatenate utterances together , um , to get as much data as we possibly can from the user . But ,  um ,  there 's a question of how to set up the models . So um , we could train the models . If we think twelve seconds is ideal we could train the models using twelve seconds to calculate the mean , to mean subtract the training data . Or we could , um , use some other amount . So  like I did an experiment where I , um , was using six seconds in test , um , but , for  I tried twelve seconds in train . And I tried , um , um , the same in train  I 'm a I tried six seconds in train . And six seconds in train  was about point three percent better .

No , it is interesting . And the other thing is , I mean , there 's two sides to these really small , uh , gradations in performance .

On the other hand , when you 're doing , uh , research , you may , eh  you might find that the way that you build up a change from a ninety - five percent accurate system to a ninety - eight percent accurate system is through ten or twelve little things that you do that each are point three percent .

OK ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "And , um , Let 's  l let 's see . Um , OK . And then there 's um , another thing I wanna start looking at , um ,  wi is , um , the choice of the analysis window length . So I 've just been using two seconds just because that 's what Carlos did before . Uh , I wrote to him asking about he chose the two seconds . And it seemed like he chose it a bit informally . So , um , with the  with the HTK set - up I should be able to do some experiments , on just varying that length , say between one and three seconds , in a few different reverberation conditions , um , say this room and also a few of the artificial impulse responses we have for reverberation , just , um , making some plots and seeing how they look . And , um , so , with the  the sampling rate I was using , one second or two seconds or four seconds is at a power of two um , number of samples and , um , I 'll  I 'll jus f for the ones in between I guess I 'll just zero - pad ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Mm - hmm . I guess one thing that might also be an issue , uh , cuz part of what you 're doing is you 're getting a  a spectrum over a bunch of different kinds of speech sounds .

So "}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Huh ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "I don't know if you have some samples of faster or slower speech but it might make a difference . I don't know ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Uh , yeah , I don't  I don't think the TI - digits data that I have , um ,  i is  would be appropriate for that ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Yeah , probably not . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "But what do you  What about if I w I fed it through some kind of , um , speech processing algorithm that changed the speech rate ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Yeah , but then you 'll have the degradation of  of , uh , whatever you do uh , added onto that . But maybe . Yeah , maybe if you get something that sounds  that  that 's  does a pretty job at that ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Yeah . Well , uh , just if you think it 's worth looking into ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "You could imagine that ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "I mean , it  it is getting a little away from reverberation ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Um , yeah . It 's just that you 're making a choice  uh , I was thinking more from the system aspect , if you 're making a choice for SmartKom , that  that  that it might be that it 's  it c the optimal number could be different , depending on "}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Yeah . Right ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Could be . I don't know ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "And  and th the third thing , um , uh , is , um , Barry explained LDA filtering to me yesterday .

Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "just sort of to de - emphasize the jarring . So I think that would sort of be the first thing to do .

And , uh , it 's still not clear to me in the long run whether the best thing to do would be to do that or to have some stylized version of the filter that looks like these things you 've trained up , because you always have the problem that it 's trained up for one condition and it isn't quite right for another . So . uh  that 's  that 's why  that 's why RASTA filter has actually ended up lasting a long time , people still using it quite a bit , because y you don't change it . So doesn't get any worse .

So , um , a actually I was just thinking about what I was asking about earlier , wi which is about having  less than say twelve seconds in the SmartKom system to do the mean subtraction .

And I found  So the  the results that I 've shown here are the complete results using the new  Well , the n the new technique is nothing but the noise estimate scaled by a factor of point five .

First you read the transcript number . Turn ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "OK , uh  What 's "}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "OK .

Uh - huh . Nice to meet you ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Hi ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Hi . OK . So we 're gonna try to finish by five so people who want to can go hear Nancy Chang 's talk , uh downstairs ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "And you guys are g giving talks on tomorrow and Wednesday lunch times ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yes ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Mmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "right ? That 's great . OK so , do y do you know what we 're gonna do ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "I thought two things uh we 'll introduce ourselves and what we do . And um we already talked with Andreas , Thilo and David and some lines of code were already written today and almost tested and just gonna say we have um again the recognizer to parser thing where we 're working on and that should be no problem and then that can be sort of developed uh as needed when we get  enter the tourism domain . em we have talked this morning with the  with Tilman about the generator ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "S"}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "and um There one of our diligent workers has to sort of volunteer to look over Tilman 's shoulder while he is changing the grammars to English"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "because w we have  we face two ways . Either we do a syllable concatenating um grammar for the English generation which is sort of starting from scratch and doing it the easy way , or we simply adopt the ah um more in - depth um style that is implemented in the German system and um are then able not only to produce strings but also the syntactic parse uh not parse not the syntactic tree that is underneath in the syntactic structure which is the way we decided we were gonna go because A , it 's easier in the beginning"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "and um it does require some  some knowledge of  of those grammars and  and  and some ling linguistic background .

OK , so that 's  Sort of one branch is to get us caught up on what 's going on .

I can do earlier in the day on Thursday , or  um  most of the time on Friday , not all ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "Thursday morning sounds fine ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Wha - but , Johno ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "what are your constraints ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "um Thursday afternoon doesn't work for me , but "}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "Neither does Thursday morning , no ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Uh Thursday morning should be fine ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Eleven ? Eleven on Thursday ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "I was just thinking I w I will  have  leavened by eleven ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Right . Right .

He 's off  off on his trip already ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "but um David is here and he 's actually knows everything about the SmartKom recognizer ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Thilo . OK well yeah maybe we 'll see if David could make it . That would be good ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "OK so facing to  to what we 've sort of been doing here um well for one thing we 're also using this room to collect data ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yeah obviously ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "um um Not this type of data ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Oh , OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "no not meeting data but sort of  sort ah our version of a wizard experiment such not like the ones in Munich but pretty close to it ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "The major difference to the Munich ones is that we do it via the telephone"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "even though all the recording is done here and so it 's a  sort of a computer call system that gives you tourist information"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "tells you how to get places . And it breaks halfway through the experiment and a human operator comes on . and part of that is sort of trying to find out whether people change their linguistic verbal behavior when first thinking they speak to a machine and then to a human ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "and we 're setting it up so that we can  we hope to implant certain intentions in people . For example um we have first looked at a simple sentence that \" How do I get to the Powder - Tower ? \" OK so you have the  castle of Heidelberg"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "and there is a tower and it 's called Powder - Tower ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Oh , OK . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "and um so What will you parse out of that sentence ? Probably something that we specified in M - three - L , that is @ @ {comment} \" action go to whatever domain , object whatever Powder - Tower \" ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Mmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "And maybe some model will tell us , some GPS module , in the mobile scenario where the person is at the moment . And um we 've sort of gone through that once before in the Deep Mail project and we noticed that first of all what are  I should 've brought some slides , but what our  So here 's the tower . Think of this as a two - dimensional representation of the tower . And our system led people here , to a point where they were facing a wall in front of the tower . There is no entrance there , but it just happens to be the closest point of the road network to the geometric center Because that 's how the algorithm works . So we took out that part of the road network as a hack and then it found actually the way to the entrance . which was now the closest point of the road network to"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "OK , geometric center . But what we actually observed in Heidelberg is that most people when they want to go there they actually don't want to enter , because it 's not really interesting . They wanna go to a completely different point where they can look at it and take a picture ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Oh , OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "And so what uh uh a s you s let 's say a simple parse from a s from an utterance won't really give us is what the person actually wants . Does he wanna go there to see it ? Does he wanna go there now ? Later ? How does the person wanna go there ? Is that person more likely to want to walk there ? Walk a scenic route ? and so forth . There are all kinds of decisions that we have identified in terms of getting to places and in terms of finding information about things . And we are constructing  and then we 've identified more or less the extra - linguistic parameters that may f play a role . Information related to the user and information related to the situation . And we also want to look closely on the linguistic information that what we can get from the utterance . That 's part of why we implant these intentions in the data collection to see whether people actually phrase things differently whether they want to enter in order to buy something or whether they just wanna go there to look at it . And um so the idea is to construct uh um suitable interfaces and a belief - net for a module that actually tries to guess what the underlying intention  was . And then enrich or augment the M - three - L structures with what it thought what more it sort of got out of that utterance . So if it can make a good suggestion , \" Hey ! \" you know , \" that person doesn't wanna enter . That person just wants to take a picture , \" cuz he just bought film , or \" that person wants to enter because he discussed the admission fee before \" . Or \" that person wants to enter because he wants to buy something and that you usually do inside of buildings \" and so forth . These ah these types of uh these bits of additional information are going to be embedded into the M - three - L structure in an  sort of subfield that we have reserved . And if the action planner does something with it , great . If not you know , then that 's also something um that we can't really  at least we {comment} want to offer the extra information . We don't really  um we 're not too worried ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "I mean  t s Ultimately if you have  if you can offer that information , somebody 's gonna s do something with it sooner or later . That 's sort of part of our belief ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "What was he saying ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "Um , for example , right now I know the GIS from email is not able to calculate these viewpoints . So that 's a functionality that doesn't exist yet to do that dynamically ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "but if we can offer it that distinction , maybe somebody will go ahead and implement it . Surely nobody 's gonna go ahead and implement it if it 's never gonna be used , so . What have I forgotten about ? Oh yeah , how we do it ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Well th uh"}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "yeah that 's the"}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "No no . It 's a good time to pause .

That 's the d"}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "um  so far I 've thought of it as sort of adding it onto the modeler knowledge module ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "OK , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "So this is one that already adds additional information to the"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Makes perfect sense . Yes ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Hmm , ah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "but it could sit anywhere in the attention - recognition I mean basically this is what attention - recognition literally sort of can "}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Well it 's supposed to do . Yeah"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Mmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "That 's what it should do ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Right ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Huh ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Well f from my understanding of what the people at Phillips were originally trying to do doesn't seem to quite fit into SmartKom currently so what they 're really doing right now is only selecting among the alternatives , the hypotheses that they 're given enriched by the domain knowledge and the um discourse modeler and so on ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "So if  if this is additional information that could be merged in by them ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "And then it would be available to action planning and  and others ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "Yeah . the "}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "let 's  let 's That w OK that was one question .

Mmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "uh the  the two levels will be as far as I 'm concerned as  uh standing here for the generation module"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Mmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "and the other is  is my understanding of what SmartKom uh is supposed to be"}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "and I  I think that fits in perfectly"}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "So  well , let me  Let me s  expand on that a little bit from the point of view of the generation ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "So the idea is that we 've actually got this all laid out an and we could show it to you ig um Robert didn't bring it today but there 's a  a belief - net which is  There 's a first cut at a belief - net that  that doesn't  it  isn't fully uh instantiated , and in particular some of the  the combination rules and ways of getting the  the conditional probabilities aren't there .

Now there are two ways one can go  a imagine doing that . For the debugging we 'll probably just have a  a drop - down menu and the  while you 're debugging you will just  OK .

Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yep . So  my suggestion then is that you um look into the currently ongoing discussion about how the action plans are supposed to look like .

No , in SmartKom terminology that 's um called a function that 's modeled by a function modeler . And it 's th that 's completely um encapsulated from th the dialogue system .

That information , and also about the Uh , what we 're calling \" the entity \" , Is it a castle , is it a bank ? Is it a s town square , is it a statue ? Whatever .

OK ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Um , so this was , uh , a , uh , proposal that we put in before on  on more  more higher level , uh , issues in meetings , from  I guess higher level from my point of view .

It 's the  second year of their doing , uh , these grants . They 're  they 're  a lot of them are  some of them anyway , are larger  larger grants than the usual , small NSF grants , and . So , they 're very competitive , and they have a first phase where you put in pre - proposals , and we  we , uh , got through that . And so th the  the next phase will be  we 'll actually be doing a larger proposal . And I 'm  I  I hope to be doing very little of it . And  uh ,  which was also true for the pre - proposal , so .

And , um , I discovered in the process a couple of  of interesting things , which , um , one of them is that , um , it seems that there are time lags involved in doing this , uh , uh , using an interface that has so much more complexity to it . And I  and I wanted to maybe ask , uh , Chuck to help me with some of the questions of efficiency . Maybe  I was thinking maybe the best way to do this in the long run may be to give them single channel parts and then piece them together later . And I  I have a script , I can piece them together .

OK .

Now , for only four speakers , that 's not gonna be too much time , but if it 's nine speakers , then that i that is more time . So it 's li you know , kind of wondering  And I think again it 's like this  it 's really valuable that Thilo 's working on the speech - nonspeech segmentation because maybe , um , we can close in on that wi without having to actually go to the time that it would take to listen to every single channel from start to finish through every single meeting ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Yeah , but those backchannels will always be a problem I think .

Right ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "And , so there 's no place where these  where the cepstral files are stored , anywhere that I can go look at and compare to the PLP ones , so whereas with our features , he 's actually storing the cepstrum on disk , and he reads those in ."}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "But it looked like he had to give it  uh even though the cepstrum is already computed , he has to give it uh a front - end parameter file .

If it 's th in the phone , but "}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "But that 's the image that they have ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "well , it  that  that could be th at the server 's side ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "It could be ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "and , well . Mmm , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "but that 's the image they have , right ? So that 's  that 's  I mean , one could argue all over the place about how things really will be in ten years . But the particular image that the cellular industry has right now is that it 's distributed speech recognition , where the , uh , uh , probabilistic part , and  and s semantics and so forth are all on the servers , and you compute features of the  uh , on the phone . So that 's  that 's what we 're involved in . We might  might or might not agree that that 's the way it will be in ten years , but that 's  that 's  that 's what they 're asking for . So  so I think that  th th it is an important issue whether it works cross - language . Now , it 's the OGI , uh , folks ' perspective right now that probably that 's not the biggest deal . And that the biggest deal is the , um envir acoustic - environment mismatch . And they may very well be right , but I  I was hoping we could just do a test and determine if that was true . If that 's true , we don't need to worry so much . Maybe  maybe we have a couple languages in the training set and that gives us enough breadth uh , uh , that  that  that the rest doesn't matter . Um , the other thing is , uh , this notion of training to uh  which I  I guess they 're starting to look at up there , {comment} training to something more like articulatory features . Uh , and if you have something that 's just good for distinguishing different articulatory features that should just be good across , you know , a wide range of languages ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Uh , but  Yeah , so I don't th I know  unfortunately I don't  I see what you 're comi where you 're coming from , I think , but I don't think we can ignore it ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "So we  we really have to do test with a real cross - language .

Now , can you include , uh , the  the target language ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Um , from a purist 's standpoint it 'd be nice not to because then you can say when  because surely someone is going to say at some point , \" OK , so you put in the German and the Finnish ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "Mmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Uh , now , what do you do , uh , when somebody has Portuguese ? \" you know ? Um , and  Uh , however , you aren't  it isn't actually a constraint in this evaluation . So I would say if it looks like there 's a big difference to put it in , then we 'd make note of it , and then we probably put in the other , because we have so many other problems in trying to get things to work well here that  that , you know , it 's not so bad as long as we  we note it and say , \" Look , we did do this \" ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "Mmm ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "And so , ideally , what you 'd wanna do is you 'd wanna run it with and without the target language and the training set for a wide range of languages ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Uh .

So there 's the slash - X - whatever disks , and then there 's slash - scratch . And both of those two kinds are not backed up . And if it 's called \" slash - scratch \" , it means it 's probably an internal disk to the machine . Um . And so that 's the kind of thing where , like if  um , OK , if you don't have an NT , but you have a  a  a Unix workstation , and they attach an external disk , {comment} it 'll be called \" slash - X - something \" uh , if it 's not backed up and it 'll be \" slash - D - something \" if it is backed up . And if it 's inside the machine on the desk , it 's called \" slash - scratch \" . But the problem is , if you ever get a new machine , they take your machine away . It 's easy to unhook the external disks , put them back on the new machine , but then your slash - scratch is gone . So , you don't wanna put anything in slash - scratch that you wanna keep around for a long period of time . But if it 's a copy of , say , some data that 's on a server , you can put it on slash - scratch because , um , first of all it 's not backed up , and second it doesn't matter if that machine disappears and you get a new machine because you just recopy it to slash - scratch .

We haven't deleted them off of the slash - DC disk that they 're on right now in Abbott , um , uh , but we  I would like to go through  sit down with you about some of these other ones and see if we can move them onto , um , this new disk also .

If we can think of something  some piece of this that 's going to be  The very fact that it is sort of just work , and i and it 's running programs and so forth , is exactly why  it 's possible that it  some piece of could be handed to someone to do , because it 's not  Uh , yeah , so that  that 's the question . And we don't have to solve it right this s second , but if we could think of some  some piece that 's  that 's well defined , that he could help with , he 's expressing a will willingness to do that ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "What about training up a , um , a multilingual net ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Uh ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Yes , maybe to , mmm , put together the  the label  the labels between TIMIT and Spanish or something like that ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "Yeah .

Yeah , that 's something that needs to be done in any event ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "So what we were just saying is that  that , um  I was arguing for ,  if possible , coming up with something that  that really was development and wasn't research because we  we 're  we have a time crunch . And so , uh , if there 's something that would  would save some time that someone else could do on some other piece , then we should think of that first . See the thing with voiced - unvoiced - silence is I really think that  that it 's  to do  to do a  a  a  a poor job is  is pretty quick , uh , or , you know , a so - so job . You can  you can  you can throw in a couple fea we know what  what kinds of features help with it ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "You can throw something in . You can do pretty well .

Another year ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Yeah , yeah . So , um  And th th the other tricky thing is , since we are , uh , even though we 're not  we don't have a strict prohibition on memory size , and  and computational complexity , uh , clearly there 's some limitation to it . So if we have to  if we say we have to have a pitch detector , say , if we  if we 're trying to incorporate pitch information , or at least some kind of harmonic  harmonicity , or something , this is another whole thing , take a while to develop . Anyway , it 's a very very interesting topic . I mean , one  I think one of the  a lot of people would say , and I think Dan would also , uh , that one of the things wrong with current speech recognition is that we  we really do throw away all the harmonicity information . Uh , we try to get spectral envelopes . Reason for doing that is that most of the information about the phonetic identity is in the spectral envelopes are not in the harmonic detail . But the harmonic detail does tell you something . Like the fact that there is harmonic detail is  is real important . So . Um . So , uh . So I think  Yeah . So  wh that  so the  the other suggestion that just came up was , well what about having him  work on the , uh ,  multilingual super f superset  kind of thing . Uh , coming up with that and then , you know , training it  training a net on that , say , um , from  from , uh  from TIMIT or something . Is that  or uh , for multiple databases .

So if you know anyone interested in  in what i 'm about to describe , tell that person to  to write a mail to me or Jerry soon , fast . Um  the idea now is to sort of come up with a high level of sort of abstract tasks \" go shopping \" um \" take in uh a batch of art \" um \" visit  do some sightseeing \" blah - blah - blah - blah - blah , sort of analogous to what Fey has started in  in  in compiling  compiling here and already  she has already gone to the trouble of  of anchoring it with specific um o {comment} um entities and real world places you will find in Heidelberg . And um . So out of these f s these high level categories the subject can pick a couple , such as if  if there is a cop uh a category in emptying your roll of film , the person can then decide \" OK , I wanna do that at this place \" , sort of make up their own itinerary a and  and tasks and the person is not allowed to take sort of this h high level category list with them , but uh the person is able to take notes on a map that we will give him and the map will be a tourist 's sort of schematic representation with  with symbols for the objects .

Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad G", "content": "But they will um  There 's nothing that says you know \" these are the things you want to do \" so they 'll say \" well these are the things I want to do \" and  Right , so they 'll have a little bit more natural interaction ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Hopefully ."}, {"speaker": "Grad G", "content": "OK . Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "So they 'll be given this map , which means that they won't have to like ask the system for in for like high level information about where things are ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Yeah it 's a schematic tourist map . So it 'll be uh i it 'll still require the  that information and An"}, {"speaker": "Grad G", "content": "It w it doesn't have like streets on it that would allow them to figure out their way "}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "N not  not  not really the street network . Nuh ."}, {"speaker": "Grad G", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "So you 're just saying like what part of town the things are in or whatever ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Yeah a and um the map is more a means for them to have the buildings and their names and maybe some ma ma major streets and their names"}, {"speaker": "Grad G", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "and we want to maybe ask them , if you have  get it sort of isolated street the  the , whatever , \" River Street \" , and they know that  they have decided that , yes , that 's where they want to do this kind of action um that they have it with them and they can actually read them or sort of have the label for the object because it 's too hard to memorize all these st strange German names . And then we 're going to have another  we 're gonna have w another trial run IE the first with that new setup tomorrow at two and we have a real interesting subject which is Ron Kay for who  those who know him , he 's the founder of ICI .

Somewhere in there , depending on the  exact case . So So that 's good . I mean , I think that , uh , one of the things that Hynek was talking about was understanding what was in the other really good proposals and  and trying to see if what should ultimately be proposed is some , uh , combination of things .

I think everybody was focused elsewhere . Um , now , one of the things that 's nice about what we did is , we do have a  a , uh  a filtering , which leads to a  a , uh  a reduction in the bandwidth in the modulation spectrum , which allows us to downsample . So , uh , as a result of that we have a reduced , um , transmission rate for the bits ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "That was misreported the first time out . It  it said the same amount because for convenience sake in the particular way that this is being tested , uh , they were repeating the packets .

Mm - hmm . Right ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "So , uh , in practice"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "So you could 've had a repeat count in there or something ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Well , n I mean , this was just a ph phoney thing just to  to fit into the  the software that was testing the errors  channel errors and so on ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Oh . Oh ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "So  so in reality , if you put this  this system in into , uh , the field , it would be twenty - four hundred bits per second , not forty - eight hundred .

Um , but , um , well , we still have to see how it all comes out ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Um , and then there 's the whole standards process , which is another thing altogether ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "When is the development set  I mean , the , uh , uh , test set results due ? Like the day before you leave or something ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Uh , probably the day after they leave , but we 'll have to   we 'll have to stop it the day before {comment} we leave ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yeah , yeah .

So   um , since we have a bit farther to travel than  some of the others ,  uh , we 'll have to get done a little quicker . But , um , I mean , it 's just tracing down these bugs . I mean , just exactly this sort of thing of , you know , why  why these features seem to be behaving differently , uh , in California than in Oregon ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": " Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Might have something to do with electricity shortage . Uh , we didn't  we didn't have enough electrons here and Uh , but , um Uh , I think , you know , the main reason for having  I mean , it only takes w to run the  the two test sets in  just in computer time is just a day or so , right ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yeah ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "So"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "it 's very short interval ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "yeah . So , I think the who the whole reason for having as long as we have , which was  like a week and a half , is  is because of bugs like that .

Yeah , it 's the same sheets ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "yeah , yeah "}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "just with the missing columns filled in ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Yeah . Well , that 'll be good . So , I 'll dis I 'll disregard these numbers . That 's  that 's  that 's good ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "So , Hynek will try to push for trying to combine , uh , different things ? Or Hmm ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Uh , well that 's  um yeah I mean , I think the question is \" Is there  is there some advantage ? \" I mean , you could just take the best system and say that 's the standard . But the thing is that if different systems are getting at good things , um , a again within the constraint of the resources , if there 's something simple that you can do Now for instance , uh , it 's , I think , very reasonable to have a standard for the terminal 's side and then for the server 's side say , \" Here 's a number of things that could be done . \" So , um , everything that we did could probably just be added on to what Alcatel did , and i it 'd probably work pretty well with them , too . So , um , uh , that 's one  one aspect of it . And then on the terminal 's side , I don't know how much , um , memory and  and CPU it takes , but it seems like the filtering  Uh , I mean , the VAD stuff they both had , right ? And , um , so  and they both had some kind of on - line normalization , right ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Uh , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Of sorts , yeah ? So  so , it seems like the main different there is the  is the , uh , filtering . And the filtering  I think if you can  shouldn't take a lot of memory to do that Uh , and I also wouldn't think the CPU , uh , would be much either for that part . So , if you can  if you can add those in  um  then , uh , you can cut the data rate in half ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "So it seems like the right thing to do is to  on the  on the terminal 's side , take what they did , if it  if it does seem to generalize well to German and Danish , uh , take what they did add in a filter , and add in some stuff on the server 's side and  and  and that 's probably a reasonable standard . Um  Uh"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "They are working on this already ? Because  yeah , Su - Sunil told me that he was trying already to put some kind of , uh , filtering in the   France Telecom ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Yeah , so that 's  that 's  that 's what That would be ideal  would be is that they could , you know , they could actually show that , in fact , a combination of some sort ,  uh , would work even better than what  what any of the systems had . And , um , then it would  it would , uh  be something to  to discuss in the meeting . But , uh , not clear what will go on . Um , I mean , on the one hand , um , sometimes people are just anxious to get a standard out there . I mean , you can always have another standard after that , but  this process has gone on for a while on  already and  and people might just wanna pick something and say , \" OK , this is it . \" And then , that 's a standard . Uh , standards are always optional . It 's just that , uh , if you disobey them , then you risk not being able to sell your product , or   Uh  um And people often work on new standards while an old standard is in place and so on . So it 's not final even if they declared a standard . The other hand , they might just say they just don't know enough yet to  to declare a standard . So you  you  you will be  you will become experts on this and know more  far more than me about the tha this particular standards process once you  you go to this meeting . So , be interested in hearing . So , uh , I 'd be , uh , interested in hearing , uh , your thoughts now I mean you 're almost done . I mean , you 're done in the sense that , um , you may be able to get some new features from Sunil , and we 'll re - run it . Uh , but other than that , you 're  you 're basically done , right ? So , uh , I 'm interested in hearing  hearing your thoughts about  where you think we should go from this ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "I mean , we tried a lot of things in a hurry , and , uh , if we can back off from this now and sort of take our time with something , and not have doing things quickly be quite so much the constraint , what  what you think would be the best thing to do ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Uh , well Hmm Well , first , uh , to really have a look at  at the speech   from these databases because , well , we tried several thing , but we did not really look  at what what 's happening , and  where is the noise , and"}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Eh"}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "It 's a novel idea . Look at the data . OK ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Or more generally , I guess , what  what is causing the degradation ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yeah , yeah . Actually , there is one thing that  well  Um , generally we  we think that  most of the errors are within phoneme classes , and so I think it could be interesting to  to see if it  I don't think it 's still true when we add noise , and  so we have  I  I guess the confusion ma the confusion matrices are very different when  when we have noise , and when it 's clean speech . And probably , there is much more  between classes errors for noisy speech ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "And  so , um Yeah , so perhaps we could have a  a large gain , eh , just by looking at improving the , uh , recognition , not of phonemes , but of phoneme classes , simply ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "And  which is a s a s a simpler problem , perhaps , but  which is perhaps important for noisy speech ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "The other thing that strikes me , just looking at these numbers is , just taking the best cases , I mean , some of these , of course , even with all of our  our wonderful processing , still are horrible kinds of numbers .

And it seems to me that , um , if that is an important idea , which , you know , might be , that one could work at it for a while , as you 're saying ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "And , uh Uh , and you had , you know , you had the multi - band things also , and , you know , there was issue of that ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yeah ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Um , Barry 's going to be , uh , continuing working on multi - band things as well ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "We were just talking about , um ,  some , uh , some work that we 're interested in . Kind of inspired by the stuff by Larry Saul with the , uh  uh , learning articulatory feature in  I think , in the case of his paper  with sonorance based on , uh , multi - band information where you have a  a combination of gradient learning an and , uh , EM ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Um , and    Um , so , I think that , you know , this is a , uh  this is a neat data set . Um , and then , uh , as we mentioned before , we also have the  the new , uh , digit set coming up from recordings in this room . So , there 's a lot of things to work with . Um and , uh what I like about it , in a way , is that , uh , the results are still so terrible . Uh   Uh   I mean , they 're much better than they were , you know . We 're talking about thirty to sixty percent , uh , error rate reduction . That 's  that 's really great stuff to  to do that in relatively short time . But even after that it 's still , you know , so poor that  that , uh , no one could really use it . So , um I think that 's great that  because  and y also because again , it 's not something  sometimes we 've gotten terrible results by taking some data , and artificially , you know , convolving it with some room response , or something  we take a very  Uh , at one point , uh , Brian and I went downstairs into the  the basement where it was  it was in a hallway where it was very reverberant and we  we made some recordings there . And then we   we , uh  uh , made a simulation of the  of the room acoustics there and  and applied it to other things ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "and uh But it was all pretty artificial , and  and , you know , how often would you really try to have your most crucial conversations in this very reverberant hallway ? Um  So , uh  This is what 's nice about the Aurora data and the data here , is that  is that it 's sort of a realistic room situation  uh , acoustics  acoustic situation , both terms in noise and reflections , and so on and n n And , uh , uh , with something that 's still relatively realistic , it 's still very very hard to do very well . So Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yeah , so d well Actually , this is  tha that 's why we  well , it 's a different kind of data . We 're not  we 're not used to work with this kind of data .

So this would be the first thing , and then , of course , try to  well ,  kind of debug what was wrong , eh , when we do Aurora test on the MSG  particularly , and on the multi - band ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Yeah . Yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Uh"}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Yeah . Yeah . No , I  I think there 's lots of  lots of good things to do with this .

What do you think ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "About"}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Anything"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "About other experiments ? Uh , now , I 'm interested in , um , uh  looking at the experiments where you use , um  uh , data from multiple languages to train the neural net .

Right ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Uh , something wrong , perhaps in the  just in the  the fact that the labels are "}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "well"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "What worked best is the hand - labeled data ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Um Uh , so , yeah .

Also , uh ,  I mean , there was just the whole notion of having multiple nets that were trained on different data .

Second thing is , never mind the different languages , just having acoustic conditions rather than training them all up in one , would it be helpful to have different ones ? So , um That was a question that was kind of raised by Mike Shire 's thesis , and on  in that case in terms of reverberation . Right ? That  that sometimes it might be better to do that .
