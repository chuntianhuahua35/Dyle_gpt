It 's the other group ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "I It was the network  network services group ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc A", "content": "Uh - huh .

That 's true ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "We have to remove it ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc A", "content": "I  I agree with that part , but I think that it would  it , uh  we need to have , uh , a  a  a message to them very clearly that  beyond this date , you can't make additional changes ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "I mean , um , I  I   i I think that somebody might  request something even though we say that .

Good ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So if we agreed ,  OK , how long is a reasonable amount of time for people to have  if we say two weeks , or if we say a month , I think we should just say that  say that , you know , i a as  um ,  \" per the  the  the , uh , page you signed , you have the ability to look over this stuff \" and so forth \" and , uh , because we w \" these , uh  I would  I would imagine some sort of generic thing that would say \" because we , uh , will continually be making these things available  to other researchers , uh , this can't be open - ended and so , uh , uh , please give us back your response within this am you know , within this amount of time \" , whatever time we agree upon ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "Well , did you read the email and look at the pages I sent ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Did I ?

OK , so "}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "And if you disagree with it , why don't you read it and give me comments on it ?"}, {"speaker": "Postdoc A", "content": "Yeah . Well  I  I think that there 's one missing line ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Well , the one thing that I did read and that you just repeated to me  was that you gave the specific date of July fifteenth ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "And you also just said that the reason you said that was because someone said it to you . So what I 'm telling you  is that what you should do is come up with a length of time that you guys think is enough"}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "and you should use that rather than  this date that you just got from somewhere . That 's all I 'm saying ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "OK ?"}, {"speaker": "Postdoc A", "content": "I ha I have one question . This is in the summer period and presumably people may be out of town . But we can make the assumption , can't we ? that , um , they will be receiving email , uh , most of the month . Right ?

Sometimes somebody will be  away and , uh , you know , there 's , uh  for any length of time that you  uh , choose  there is some person sometime who will not  end up reading it ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc A", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "That 's  it 's , you know , just a certain risk to take ."}, {"speaker": "PhD H", "content": "S so maybe when  Am I on , by the way ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "I don't know . You should be ."}, {"speaker": "PhD H", "content": "Oh . Hello ? Hello ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "You should be channel B ."}, {"speaker": "PhD H", "content": "Oh , OK . Alright . So . The , um  Maybe we should say in  w you know , when the whole thing starts , when they sign the   the agreement  that  you know , specify exactly uh , what , you know , how  how they will be contacted and they can , you know  they can be asked to give a phone number and an email address , or both .

A And , then , you know , say very clearly that if they don't  if we don't hear from them , you know , as Morgan suggested , by a certain time or after a certain  period after we contact them  that is implicitly giving their agreement ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "Well , they 've already signed a form ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc A", "content": "And the form says "}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "And nobody  nobody really reads it anyway ."}, {"speaker": "PhD H", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "So .
