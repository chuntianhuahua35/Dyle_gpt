Uh , we  I think the things that we talk about in this meeting uh tend to be a mixture of uh procedural uh mundane things and uh research points and um I was thinking I think it was a meeting a couple of weeks ago that we  we spent much of the time talking about the mundane stuff cuz that 's easier to get out of the way and then we sort of drifted into the research and maybe five minutes into that Andreas had to leave . So  uh I 'm suggesting we turn it around and  and uh sort of we have  anybody has some mundane points that we could send an email later , uh hold them for a bit , and let 's talk about the  the research - y kind of things . Um , so um the one th one thing I know that we have on that is uh we had talked a  a couple weeks before um uh about the uh  the stuff you were doing with  with uh um uh l l attempting to locate events , we had a little go around trying to figure out what you meant by \" events \" but I think , you know , what we had meant by \" events \" I guess was uh points of overlap between speakers .

So that 's something I 'd like somebody to do at some point , just take these digits , take the far - field mike signal , and the close uh mike signal , and apply really good echo cancellation .

And if you figure out well what 's the  there 's a  a least squares algorithm that adjusts itself  adjusts the weight so that you try to subtract  essentially to subtract off uh different uh  different reflections . Right ? So let 's take the simple case where you just had  you had some uh some delay in a satellite connection or something and then there 's a  there 's an echo . It comes back . And you want to adjust this filter so that it will maximally reduce the effect of this echo ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "So that would mean like if you were listening to the data that was recorded on one of those .

OK ? So now , if you um try to r you  To completely remove the effect of that is sort of impractical for a number of technical reasons , but I  but  not to try to completely remove it , that is , invert the  the room response , but just to try to uh uh eliminate some of the  the effect of some of the echos . Um , a number of people have done this so that , say , if you 're talking to a speakerphone , uh it makes it more like it would be , if you were talking right up to it . So this is sort of the st the straight - forward approach . You say I  I  I want to use this uh  this item but I want to subtract off various kinds of echos . So you construct a filter , and you have this  this filtered version uh of the speech um gets uh uh  gets subtracted off from the original speech . Then you try to  you try to minimize the energy in some sense . And so um  uh with some constraints ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Kind of a clean up thing , that "}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "It 's a clean up thing . Right ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "So , echo cancelling is  is , you know , commonly done in telephony , and  and  and it 's sort of the obvious thing to do in this situation if you  if , you know , you 're gonna be talking some distance from a mike ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "When uh , I would have meetings with the folks in Cambridge when I was at BBN over the phone , they had a um  some kind of a special speaker phone and when they would first connect me , it would come on and we 'd hear all this noise .

I think that 'd be enough data  plenty of data to do that with , and i for that sort of task you wouldn't care whether it was uh large vocabulary speech or anything . Uh .  Um"}, {"speaker": "Postdoc B", "content": "Is Brian Kingsbury 's work related to that , or is it a different type of reverberation ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Brian 's {comment} Kingsbury 's work is an example of what we did f f from the opposite dogma . Right ? Which is what I was calling the \" party line \" , which is that uh doing that sort of thing is not really what we want . We want something more flexible , uh i i where people might change their position , and there might be , you know  There 's also um oh yeah , noise . So the echo cancellation does not really allow for noise . It 's if you have a clean situation but you just have some delays , Then we 'll figure out the right  the right set of weights for your taps for your filter in order to produce the effect of those  those echos . But um if there 's noise , then the very signal that it 's looking at is corrupted so that it 's decision about what the right  you know , right  right uh  delays are  is , uh  is  right delayed signal is  is  is  uh is incorrect . And so , in a noisy situation , um , also in a  in a situation that 's very reverberant  {comment} with long reverberation times {comment} and really long delays , it 's  it 's sort of typically impractical . So for those kind of reasons , and also a  a c a complete inversion , if you actually  I mentioned that it 's kind of hard to really do the inversion of the room acoustics . Um , that 's difficult because um often times the  the um   the system transfer function is such that when it 's inverted you get something that 's unstable , and so , if you  you do your estimate of what the system is , and then you try to invert it , you get a filter that actually uh , you know , rings , and  and uh goes to infinity . So it 's  so there 's  there 's  there 's that sort of technical reason , and the fact that things move , and there 's air currents  I mean there 's all sorts of  all sorts of reasons why it 's not really practical . So for all those kinds of reasons , uh we  we  we sort of um , concluded we didn't want to in do inversion , and we 're even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation , which isn't really inversion , and um we decided to do this approach of taking  uh , just picking uh features , which were  uh will give you more  something that was more stable , in the presence of , or absence of , room reverberation , and that 's what Brian was trying to do . So , um , let me just say a couple things that I was  I was gonna bring up . Uh . Let 's see .

It won't be that many people who do it  that often , but um just , you know , so long as they don't forget that they 've done it , I guess ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "OK . Um , back on the data thing , so there 's this sort of one hour , ten hour , a hundred hour sort of thing that  that we have .

There are a number of interesting questions that you can ask about how interactions happen in a meeting , that don't require any transcription . So what are the patterns , the energy patterns over the meeting ? And I 'm really interested in this  but we don't have a whole lot of data .

So I  I  uh , I  I 'd mentioned to Adam , and  that was another thing I was gonna talk  uh , mention to them before  {comment} that uh there 's uh  It  it oc it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data by talking to uh acquaintances in local broadcast media .

Um and so I do think we 're gonna continue recording here and record what we can .

No , I think that 'd be great , if we can get more data ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "So , {comment} I  I  I  I was thinking of looking into that . the other thing that occurred to me after we had that discussion , in fact , is that it 's even possible , since of course , many radio shows are not live , {comment} uh that we could invite them to have like some of their  {comment} record some of their shows here ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc B", "content": "Wow !"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Well  Or  The thing is , they 're not as averse to wearing one of these head - mount I mean , they 're on the radio ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad G", "content": "Right , as we are ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "right ?

I mean , they already do what they do  do whatever they do . So it 's  uh , it 's  So it 's  so it 's another source . So I think it 's something we should look into , you know , we 'll collect what we collect here hopefully they will collect more at UW also and um  and maybe we have this other source . But yeah I think that it 's not unreasonable to aim at getting , you know , significantly in excess of a hundred hours . I mean , that was sort of our goal . The thing was , I was hoping that we could  @ @ in the  under this controlled situation we could at least collect , you know , thirty to fifty hours .

I don't know what the guys in Kaiserslautern have running because e the version  that is , the full version that 's on the server d does not work . And you need to do a lot of stuff to make it work . And so it 's  And even Tilman and Ralf sort of said \" yeah there never was a really working version that uh did it without th all the shortcuts that they built in for the uh October @ @ version \" . So we 're actually maybe ahead of the System Gruppe by now , the system  the integration group . And it was , uh  It was fun to some extent , but the uh the outcome that is sort of of scientific interest is that I think both Ralf and Tilman  um , I know that they enjoyed it here , and they r they  they liked , uh , a lot of the stuff they saw here , what  what we have been thinking about , and they 're more than willing to  to um , cooperate , by all means . And um , part of my responsibility is uh to use our internal \" group - ware \" server at EML , make that open to all of us and them , so that whatever we discuss in terms of parsing and  and generating and constructions w we  we sort of uh put it in there and they put what they do in there and maybe we can even um , get some overlap , get some synergy out of that . And um , the , uh  If I find someone at  in EML that is interested in that , um I  I may even think that we could look  take constructions and  and generate from them because the tree adjoining grammars that  that Tilman is using is as you said nothing but a mathematical formalism . And you can just do anything with it , whether it 's syntactic trees , H P S G - like stuff , or whether it 's construction .

Going back I guess two weeks ago uh Robert had laid out this belief - net , missing only the connections . Right ? That is  {comment} So , he 'd put all th all the dots down , and we went through this , and , I think , more or less convinced ourselves that at least the vast majority of the nodes that we needed for the demo level we were thinking of , were in there . Yeah {comment} we may run across one or two more . But of course the connections weren't . So , uh Bhaskara and I went off and looked at some technical questions about were certain operations sort of legitimate belief - net computations and was there some known problem with them or had someone already uh , solved you know how to do this and stuff . And so Bhaskara tracked that down . The answer seems to be uh , \" no , no one has done it , but yes it 's a perfectly reasonable thing to do if that 's what you set out to do \" .

So Bhaskara is switching projects as of the first of June , and uh , he 's gonna leave us an inheritance , which is a uh  hopefully a belief - net that does these things . And there 're two aspects to it , one of which is , you know , technical , getting the coding right , and making it run , and uh stuff like that . And the other is the actual semantics . OK ?

So this is  The project is called Meeting Recorder and there are lots of different aspects of the project . Um . So my particular interest is in the PDA of the future . This is a mock - up of one . Yes , we do believe the PDA of the future will be made of wood . Um . {comment} The idea is that you 'd be able to put a PDA at the table at an impromptu meeting , and record it , and then be able to do querying and retrieval later on , on the meeting . So that 's my particular interest , is a portable device to do m uh , information retrieval on meetings . Other people are interested in other aspects of meetings . Um . So the first step on that , in any of these , is to collect some data . And so what we wanted is a room that 's instrumented with both the table top microphones , and these are very high quality pressure zone mikes , as well as the close talking mikes . What the close talk ng talking mikes gives us is some ground truth , gives us , um , high quality audio , um , especially for people who aren't interested in the acoustic parts of this corpus . So , for people who are more interested in language , we didn't want to penalize them by having only the far field mikes available . And then also , um , it 's a very , very hard task in terms of speech recognition . Um . And so , uh , on the far field mikes we can expect very low recognition results . So we wanted the near field mikes to at least isolate the difference between the two . So that 's why we 're recording in parallel with the close talking and the far field at the same time . And then , all these channels are recorded simultaneously and framed synchronously so that you can also do things like , um , beam - forming on all the microphones and do research like that . Our intention is to release this data to the public , um , probably through f through a body like the LDC . And , uh , just make it as a generally available corpus . Um .  There 's other work going on in meeting recording . So , we 're  we 're working with SRI , with UW , Um . NIST has started an effort which will include video . We 're not including video , obviously . And uh  and then also , um , a small amount of assistance from IBM . Is also involved . Um . Oh , and the digit strings , this is just a more constrained task . Um . So because the general environment is so challenging , we decided to  to do at least one set of digit strings to give ourselves something easier .

Um . We could pursue , um , if we thought it 's  it 's worth it but , uh , I think we  we will agree on that , um , to come up with a  with a sort of very , very first crude prototype , and do some implementation work , and do some  some research , and some modeling . So the idea is if you want to go somewhere , um , and focus on that object down  Oh , I can actually walk with this . This is nice . down here . That 's the Powder - Tower . Now , um ,  we found in our , uh , data and from experiments , that there 's three things you can do . Um , you can walk this way , and come really , really close to it . And touch it . But you cannot enter or do anything else . Unless you 're interested in rock climbing , it won't do you no good standing there . It 's just a dark alley . But you can touch it . If you want to actually go up or into the tower , you have to go this way , and then through some buildings and up some stairs and so forth . If you actually want to see the tower , and that 's what actually most people want to do , is just have a good look of it , take a picture for the family , {comment} you have to go this way , and go up here . And there you have a vre really view  It exploded , the  during the Thirty years - war . Really uh , interesting sight . And um , these uh  these lines are , um , paths ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Mmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "or so That 's ab er , i the street network of our geographic information system . And you can tell that we deliberately cut out this part . Because otherwise we couldn't get our GIS system to take  to lead people this way . It would always use the closest point to the object , and then the tourists would be faced , you know , in front of a wall , but it would do them absolutely no good . So ,  what we found interesting is , first of all , intentions differ . Maybe you want to enter a building . Maybe you want to see it , take a picture of it . Or maybe you actually want to come as close as possible to the building . For whatever reason that may be ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "What 's it  what 's it made out of ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "Um , r red limestone ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "So maybe you would wanna touch it ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "Yeah , maybe you would want to touch it . Um . Okay , I  This , um  These intentions , we  w w we could , if we want to , call it the  the Vista mode , where we just want to  eh  s get the overview or look at it , the Enter mode , and the , well , Tango mode . I always come up with  with silly names . So this \" Tango \" means , literally translated , \" to touch \" . So  But sometimes the  the Tango mode is really relevant in the  in the sense that , um , if you want to , uh  If you don't have the intention of entering your building , but you know that something is really close to it , and you just want to approach it , or get to that building . Consider , for example , the Post Office in Chicago , a building so large that it has its own zip code . So the entrance could be miles away from the closest point . So sometimes it m m m makes sense maybe to d to distinguish there . So , um , I 've looked , uh , through twenty some  Uh , I didn't look through all the data . um , and there  there 's uh , a lot more different ways in people  uh , the ways people phrase how to g get  if they want to get to a certain place .

OK , good ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "OK . It 's on ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "OK . That was the idea . Um , people , when they w when they want to go to a building , sometimes they just want to look at it . Sometimes they want to enter it . And sometimes they want to get really close to it . That 's something we found . It 's just a truism . And the places where you will lead them for these intentions are sometimes ex in incredibly different . I  I gave an example where the point where you end up if you want to look at it is completely different from where  if you want to enter it . So , this is sort of how people may , uh  may phrase those requests to a  a  a mock - up system at least that 's the way they did it . And we get tons of  of these \" how do I get to \" , \" I want to go to \" , but also , \" give me directions to \" , and \" I would like to see \" . And um , what we can sort of do , if we look closer a closer at the  the data  That was the wrong one . um , we can look at some factors that may make a difference . First of all , very important , and um , that  I 've completely forgot that when we talked . This is of course a crucial factor , \" what type of object is it ? \" So , some buildings you just don't want to take pictures of . Or very rarely . But you usually want to enter them . Some objects are more picturesque , and you  more f more highly photographed . Then of course the  the actual phrases may give us some idea of what the person wants . Um . Sometimes I found in the  Uh , looking at the data , in a superficial way , I found some s sort of modifiers that  that m may also give us a hint , um , \" I 'm trying to get to \" Nuh ? \" I need to get to \" . Sort of hints to the fact that you 're not really sightseeing and  and just f there for pleasure and so forth and so on . And this leads us straight to the context which also should be considered . That whatever it is you 're doing at the moment may also inter influence the interpretation of  of a phrase . So , this is , uh , really uh , uh , uh  My suggestion is really simple . We start with , um  Now , Let me , uh , say one more thing . What we do know , is that the parser we use in the SmartKom system will never differentiate between any of these . So , basically all of these things will result in the same XML M - three - L structure . Sort of action \" go \" , and then an object ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "Yeah ? and a source . So it 's  it 's  it 's way too crude to d capture those differences in intentions . So , I thought , \" Mmm ! Maybe for a deep understanding task , that 's a nice sort of playground or first little thing . \" Where we can start it and n sort of look  \" OK , we need , we gonna get those M - three - L structures . The crude , undifferentiated parse . Interpreted input . We may need additional part of speech , or maybe just some information on the verb , and modifiers , auxiliaries . We 'll see . And I will try to  to sort of come up with a list of factors that we need to get out of there , and maybe we want to get a g switch for the context . So this is not something which we can actually monitor ,  now , but just is something we can set . And then you can all imagine sort of a  a constrained satisfaction program , depending on  on what , um , comes out . We want to have an  a structure resulting if we feed it through a belief - net or  or something along those lines . We 'd get an inferred intention , we  we produce a structure that differentiates between the Vista , the Enter , and the , um , Tango mode . Which I think we maybe want to ignore . But . That 's my idea . It 's up for discussion . We can change all of it , any bit of it . Throw it all away ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "Now @ @ this email that you sent , actually ."}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "What ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "Now I remember the email ."}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Huh .

So we think it 's a well - formed , uh , starter task for this , uh , deeper understanding in the tourist domain ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "So , where exactly is the , uh , deeper understanding being done ? Like I mean , s is it before the Bayes - net ? Is it , uh "}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "Well , it 's the  it 's  it 's always all of it . So , in general it 's always going to be , the answer is , everywhere . Uh , so the notion is that , uh , this isn't real deep . But it 's deep enough that you can distinguish between these th three quite different kinds of , uh , going to see some tourist thing . And , so that 's  that 's the quote \" deep \" that we 're trying to get at . And , Robert 's point is that the current front - end doesn't give you any way to  Not only doesn't it do it , but it also doesn't give you enough information to do it . It isn't like , if you just took what the front - end gives you , and used some clever inference algorithm on it , you would be able to figure out which of these is going on . So , uh , and this is  Bu - I in general it 's gonna be true of any kind of deep understanding , there 's gonna be contextual things , there 're gonna be linguistic things , there 're gonna be discourse things , and they gotta be combined . And , my idea on how to combine them is with a belief - net , although it may turn out that t some totally different thing is gonna work better .

So the thing is ,  i uh , d naively speaking , you 've  you 've got a  for this little task , a belief - net , which is going to have as output , the conditional pr probability of one of three things , that the person wants to  uh , to View it , to Enter it , or to Tango with it . Um . So that  the  the output of the belief - net is pretty well formed . And , then the inputs are going to be these kinds of things . And , then the question is  there are two questions  is , uh , one , where do you get this i {comment} information from , and two , what 's the structure of the belief - net ? So what are the conditional probabilities of this , that , and the other , given these things ? And you probably need intermediate nodes . I  we don't know what they are yet .

Um "}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "And , also um , I was just showing Andreas , I got um an X Waves kind of display , and I don't know how much more we can do with it  with like the prosodic stuff where we have like stylized pitches and signals and the transcripts on the bottom"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Oh , cool ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "so , right now it 's just an X Waves and then you have three windows but I don't know , it looked pretty nice and I 'm sure it  think it has potential for a little something ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "For a demo ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "yeah , for a demo ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Yeah , sounds good ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "So "}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "OK , so again , the issue is  For July , the issue 's gonna be what can we fit into a Windows machine , uh , and so on , but "}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Oh . OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "So it might just be slides ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Yeah , OK ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Well   Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Well , we 'll see , um "}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "I 've been putting together uh Transcriber things for Windows so i And I installed it on Dave Gelbart 's PC and it worked just fine .

Yeah but  But the problem is the version Transcriber works with , the Snack version , is one point six whatever and that 's not anymore supported . It 's not on  on the web page anymore .

Yeah , but then you can't add our patches and then the  the new version is  is totally different"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Oh ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "a and in  yeah , in terms of  of the source code ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Ah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "You  you can't find the Tcl files anymore . It 's some whatever wrapped thing"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Mmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "and you can't  you can't access that so you have to install  First install Tcl then install Snack and then install the Transcriber thing and then do the patches ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Patch .

And we 'll do "}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Oh . OK , sure . So , um , last week I finally got results from the SRI system about this mean subtraction approach . And , um , we  we got an improvement , uh , in word error rate , training on the TI - digits data set and testing on Meeting Recorder digits of , um ,  six percent to four point five percent , um , on the n on the far - mike data using PZM F , but , um , the near - mike performance worsened , um , from one point two percent to two point four percent . And , um , wh why would that be , um ,  considering that we actually got an improvement in near - mike performance using HTK ? And so , uh , with some input from , uh , Andreas , I have a theory in two parts . Um , first of all HTK  sorry , SR - the SRI system is doing channel adaptation , and so HTK wasn't . Um , so this , um  This mean subtraction approach will do a kind of channel  normalization and so that might have given the HTK use of it a boost that wouldn't have been applied in the SRI case . And also , um , the  Andreas pointed out the SRI system is using more parameters . It 's got finer - grained acoustic models . So those finer - grained acoustic models could be more sensitive to the artifacts  in the re - synthesized audio . Um . And me and Barry were listening to the re - synthesized audio and sometimes it seems like you get of a bit of an echo of speech in the background . And so that seems like it could be difficult for training , cuz you could have  different phones  lined up with a different foreground phone ,  um ,  depending on  the timing of the echo . So , um , I 'm gonna try training on a larger data set , and then , eh , the system will have seen more examples o of these artifacts and hopefully will be more robust to them . So I 'm planning to use the Macrophone set of , um , read speech , and , um  Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "I had another thought just now , which is , uh , remember we were talking before about  we were talking in our meeting about , uh , this stuff that  some of the other stuff that Avendano did , where they were , um , getting rid of low - energy  sections ? Um , uh , if you  if you did a high - pass filtering , as Hirsch did in  late eighties to reduce some of the effects of reverberation , uh , uh , Avendano and Hermansky were arguing that , uh , perhaps one of the reasons for that working was ma may not have even been the filtering so much but the fact that when you filter a  an all - positive power spectrum you get some negative values , and you gotta figure out what to do with them if you 're gonna continue treating this as a power spectrum . So , what  what Hirsch did was , uh , set them to zero  set the negative values to zero . So if you imagine a  a waveform that 's all positive , which is the time trajectory of energy , um , and , uh , shifting it downwards , and then getting rid of the negative parts , that 's essentially throwing away the low - energy things . And it 's the low - energy parts of the speech where the reverberation is most audible . You know , you have the reverberation from higher - energy things showing up in  So in this case you have some artificially imposed  reverberation - like thing . I mean , you 're getting rid of some of the other effects of reverberation , but because you have these non - causal windows , you 're getting these funny things coming in , uh , at n And , um , what if you did  ? I mean , there 's nothing to say that the  the processing for this re - synthesis has to be restricted to trying to get it back to the original , according to some equation .

So , uh  u th I 've been playing with this Wiener filter , like . And there are  there were some bugs in the program , so I was p initially trying to clear them up . Because one of the bug was  I was assuming that always the VAD  uh , the initial frames were silence . It always started in the silence state , but it wasn't for some utterances .

Yeah . There 're a few cases , actually , which I found later , that there are ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "o Uh - huh ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "So that was one of the  bugs that was there in estimating the noise . And , uh , so once it was cleared , uh , I ran a few experiments with  different ways of smoothing the estimated clean speech and how t estimated the noise and , eh , smoothing the SNR also . And so the  the trend seems to be like ,  uh , smoothing the  current estimate of the clean speech for deriving the SNR , which is like  deriving the Wiener filter , seems to be helping . Then updating it quite fast using a very small time constant . So we 'll have , like , a few results where the  estimating the  the  More smoothing is helping . But still it 's like  it 's still comparable to the baseline . I haven't got anything beyond the baseline . But that 's , like , not using any Wiener filter . And , uh , so I 'm  I 'm trying a few more experiments with different time constants for smoothing the noise spectrum , and smoothing the clean speech , and smoothing SNR . So there are three time constants that I have . So , I 'm just playing around . So , one is fixed in the line , like  Smoothing the clean speech is  is helping , so I 'm not going to change it that much . But , the way I 'm estimating the noise and the way I 'm estimating the SNR , I 'm just trying  trying a little bit . So , that h And the other thing is , like , putting a floor on the , uh , SNR , because that  if some  In some cases the clean speech is , like  when it 's estimated , it goes to very low values , so the SNR is , like , very low . And so that actually creates a lot of variance in the low - energy region of the speech . So , I 'm thinking of , like , putting a floor also for the SNR so that it doesn't  vary a lot in the low - energy regions . And , uh . So . The results are , like  So far I 've been testing only with the  baseline , which is  which doesn't have any LDA filtering and on - line normalization . I just want to separate the  the contributions out . So it 's just VAD , plus the Wiener filter , plus the baseline system , which is , uh , just the spectral  I mean , the mel sp mel , uh , frequency coefficients . Um . And the other thing that I tried was  but I just  took of those , uh ,   Carlos filters , which Hynek had , to see whether it really h helps or not . I mean , it was just a  a run to see whether it really degrades or it helps . And it 's  it seems to be like it 's not  hurting a lot by just blindly picking up one filter which is nothing but a  four hertz  a band - pass m m filter on the cubic root of the power spectrum . So , that was the filter that Hy - uh , Carlos had . And so  Yeah . Just  just to see whether it really  it 's  it 's  is it worth trying or not . So , it doesn't seems to be degrading a lot on that . So there must be something that I can  that can be done with that type of noise compensation also , which   I guess I would ask Carlos about that . I mean , how  how he derived those filters and  and where d if he has any filters which are derived on OGI stories , added with some type of noise which  what we are using currently , or something like that . So maybe I 'll "}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "This is cubic root of power spectra ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "Yeah . Cubic root of power spectrum ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So , if you have this band - pass filter , you probably get n you get negative values . Right ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "Yeah . And I 'm , like , floating it to z zeros right now ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "So it has , like  the spectrogram has , like  Uh , it actually , uh , enhances the onset and offset of  I mean , the  the begin and the end of the speech . So it 's  there seems to be , like , deep valleys in the begin and the end of , like , high - energy regions ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "because the filter has , like , a sort of Mexican - hat type structure ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "So , those are the regions where there are , like  when I look at the spectrogram , there are those deep valleys on the begin and the end of the speech .

And certain things that have , um , changed , have changed back to this . There  there 's been a little bit of , um , going back and forth .

So I 'll just try to go through them . So they could all have a type at the beginning . Um , and then they say the key word construction"}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "Oh , I see ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "and they have some name ."}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "So  so the current syntax is if it s if there 's a type it 's before construct"}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "Yeah , right ."}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "OK , that 's fine ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "OK , and then it has a block that is constituents . And as usual I guess all the constructions her all the examples here have only , um , tsk {comment} one type of constituent , that is a constructional constituent . I think that 's actually gonna turn out to m be certainly the most common kind . But in general instead of the word \" construct \" , th here you might have \" meaning \" or \" form \" as well . OK ? So if there 's some element that doesn't  that isn't yet constructional in the sense that it maps form and meaning . OK , um , the main change with the constructs which  each of which has , um , the key word \" construct \" and then some name , and then some type specification , is that it 's  it 's pro it 's often  sometimes the case in the first case here that you know what kind of construction it is . So for example whatever I have here is gonna be a form of the word \" throw \" , or it 's gonna be a form of the word , you know , I don't know , \" happy \" , or something like that . Or , you know , some it 'll be a specific word or maybe you 'll have the type . You 'll say \" I need a p uh spatial relation phrase here \" or \" I need a directional specifier here \" . So - uh you could have a j a actual type here . Um , or you could just say in the second case that you only know the meaning type . So a very common example of this is that , you know , in directed motion , the first person to do something should be an agent of some kind , often a human . Right ? So if I  you know , the um , uh , run down the street then I  I  I run down the street , it 's typed , uh , \" I \" , meaning category is what 's there . The  the new kind is this one that is sort of a pair and , um , sort of skipping fonts and whatever . The idea is that sometimes there are , um , general constructions that you know , that you 're going to need . It 's  it 's the equivalent of a noun phrase or a prepositional phrase , or something like that there ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "And usually it has formal um , considerations that will go along with it ."}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "And then uh , you might know something much more specific depending on what construction you 're talking about , about what meaning  what specific meaning you want .

Um , so I don't know if the syntax will hold but something that gives you a way to do both constructional and meaning types . So . OK , then I don't think the , {comment} um  at least  Yeah . {comment} None of these examples have anything different for formal constraints ? But you can refer to any of the , um , sort of available elements and scope , right ? which here are the constructs , {comment} to say something about the relation . And I think i if you not if you compare like the top block and the textual block , um , we dropped like the little F subscript .

Like if you were giving a formal constraint then you 're referring to the formal pole of that . So  so by saying  if I just said \" Name one \" then that means name one formal and we 're talking about formal struc {comment} Which  which makes sense . Uh , there are certain times when we 'll have an exception to that , in which case you could just indicate \" here I mean the meaningful for some reason \" . Right ?

OK , and so in terms of the  the relations , you know , as usual they 're before and ends . I should have put an example in of something that isn't an interval relation but in form you might also have a value binding .

But for instance you could imagine instead of having  I  I changed the name of  um it used to be \" entities \" . So you see it 's \" scenario \" , \" referent \" and \" discourse segment \" . And \" scenario \" is essentially what kind of  what 's the basic predication , what event happened . And actually it 's just a list of various slots from which you would draw  draw in order to paint your picture , a bunch of frames , bi and bindings , right ? Um , and obviously there are other ones that are not included here , general cultural frames and general like , uh , other action f"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "you know , specific X - schema frames . OK , whatever . The middle thing used to be \" entities \" because you could imagine it should be like really a list where here was various information . And this is intended to be grammatically specifiable information about a referent  uh , you know , about some entity that you were going to talk about . So \" Harry walked into the room \" , \" Harry \" and \" room \" , you know , the room  th but they would be represented in this list somehow . And it could also have for instance , it has this category slot . Um , it should be either category or in or instance . Basically , it could be a pointer to ontology . So that everything you know about this could be  could be drawn in . But the important things for grammatical purposes are for  things like number , gender , um  ki the ones I included here are slightly arbitrary but you could imagine that , um , you need to figure out wheth if it 's a group whether , um , some event is happening , linear time , linear spaces , like , you know , are  are they doing something serially or is it like , um , uh I 'm  I 'm not sure . Because this partly came from , uh , Talmy 's schema and I 'm not sure we 'll need all of these actually . But  Um , and then the \" status \" I used was like , again , in some languages , you know , like for instance in child language you might distinguish between different status . So , th the  the big com and  and finally \" discourse segment \" is about  sort of speech - act - y information structure - y , like utterance - specific kinds of things . So the comment I was going to make about , um , changing entity  the entity 's block to reference is that  you can imagine your discourse like situation context , you have a set of entities that you 're sort of referring to . And you might  that might be sort of a general , I don't know , database of all the things in this discourse that you could refer to . And I changed to \" reference \" cuz I would say , for a particular utterance you have particular referring expressions in it . And those are the ones that you get information about that you stick in here . For instance , I know it 's going to be plural . I know it 's gonna be feminine or something like that . And  and these could actually just point to , you know , the  the ID in my other list of enti active entities , right ? So , um , uh , th there 's  there 's all this stuff about discourse status . We 've talked about . I almost listed \" discourse status \" as a slot where you could say it 's active .

Um , yeah , and about multi - band , uh , I started multi - band MLP trainings , um mmh {comment} Actually , I w I w hhh {comment} prefer to do exactly what I did when I was in Belgium . So I take exactly the same configurations , seven bands with nine frames of context , and we just train on TIMIT , and on the large database , so , with SPINE and everything .

So , this would  would be something between TRAPS and multi - band because we still have quite large bands , and  but with a lot of context also . So Um Yeah , we still have to work on Finnish , um , basically , to make a decision on which MLP can be the best across the different languages .

Well , see , i oc You were doing some something that was  So maybe the analogy isn't quite right . You were doing something that was in way a little better behaved . You had reverb for a single variable which was re uh , uh , reverberation . Here the problem seems to be is that we don't have a hug a really huge net with a really huge amount of training data . But we have s f  for this kind of task , I would think ,  sort of a modest amount . I mean , a million frames actually isn't that much . We have a modest amount of  of uh training data from a couple different conditions , and then uh  in  yeah , that  and the real situation is that there 's enormous variability that we anticipate in the test set in terms of language , and noise type uh , and uh ,  uh , channel characteristic , sort of all over the map . A bunch of different dimensions . And so , I 'm just concerned that we don't really have  um , the data to train up  I mean one of the things that we were seeing is that when we added in  we still don't have a good explanation for this , but we are seeing that we 're adding in uh , a fe few different databases and uh the performance is getting worse and uh , when we just take one of those databases that 's a pretty good one , it actually is  is  is  is  is better . And uh that says to me , yes , that , you know , there might be some problems with the pronunciation models that some of the databases we 're adding in or something like that . But one way or another  we don't have uh , seemingly , the ability  to represent , in the neural net of the size that we have , um , all of the variability  that we 're gonna be covering . So that I 'm  I 'm  I 'm hoping that um , this is another take on the efficiency argument you 're making , which is I 'm hoping that with moderate size neural nets , uh , that uh if we  if they look at more constrained conditions they  they 'll have enough parameters to really represent them .

I  I just sort of have a feeling "}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "But  Yeah . Mm - hmm . "}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Yeah .

Uh first we discussed about some of the points that I was addressing in the mail I sent last week ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Uh - huh ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "So . Yeah . About the um , well  the downsampling problem ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Uh and about the f the length of the filters and  Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "What was the  w what was the downsampling problem again ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "So we had "}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "I forget ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "So the fact that there  there is no uh low - pass filtering before the downsampling .

Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "So you could do a  you could do a stricter one ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "System on"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Maybe . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah .

Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "I see ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "I guess ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Yeah .

Uh .  Um ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah . Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Sorry at twenty - five hertz since they 're downsampling by two . So . Does anybody know what the frequency characteristic is ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "We don't have yet"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Oh OK ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "um  So , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "We should have a look first at , perhaps ,  the modulation spectrum ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Um .

We started to work with this ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Hmm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Mmm .

And this  we 've not uh worked on this yet . Um , yeah . And so while discussing about these  these LDA filters , some i issues appeared , like well , the fact that if we look at the frequency response of these filters it 's uh , well , we don't know really what 's the important part in the frequency response and there is the fact that  in the very low frequency , these filters don't  don't really remove a lot .  compared to the  to the uh standard RASTA filter .

Um . Yeah , but perhaps everything could  should be  could be in the filter , I mean , uh the  the mean normalization and  Yeah . So . Yeah . So basically that was  that 's  all we discussed about . We discussed about  good things to do also uh well , generally good stuff  to do for the research ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "And this was this LDA uh tuning perhaps and  Hynek proposed again to his uh TRAPS , so ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "I mean I g I guess the key thing for me is  is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two sides"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "um ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "cuz  because um"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "uh I was talking with Hynek about it later and the  the  sort of had the sense sort of that  that neither group of people wanted to  to bother the other group too much . And  and I don't think anybody is , you know , closed in in their thinking or are unwilling to talk about things but I think that  you were sort of waiting for them to  tell you that they had something for you and  and that  and expected that they would do certain things and they were sor they didn't wanna bother you"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "and  they were sort of waiting for you and  and  and uh we ended up with this thing where they  they were filling up all of the possible latency themselves , and they just had hadn't thought of that .

Yeah . Yeah . Well "}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "in  in uh  the other "}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah I don't know what happened really , but"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "I guess it 's  it 's also so uh the time constraints .

I see ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "uh yeah . But there was also problem  perhaps a problem of communication . So , yeah . Now we will try to "}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Just talk more ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah , slikes and send mails ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "u s o o Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Uh . OK ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "So there 's um  Alright .

Um what was it , there was  there was some  some  some point where  eh uh Eric or somebody was  was speaking and he had lots of  silence in his channel and I was saying something to somebody else uh  which was in the background and it was not  it was recognizing my words , which were the background speech  on the close   close mike ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Oh the  What we talked about yesterday ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Yes ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Yeah that was actually my  I was wearing the  I was wearing the lapel and you were sitting next to me ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Oh you  it was you I was Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "and I only said one thing but you were talking and it was picking up all your words ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Yeah . Yeah . So they would like clean channels . Uh and for that  mmm uh  that purpose uh they 'd like to pull it out .

So ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Right . Right ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "So you 're talking about using that data to get uh instead of using canonical mappings of phones ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "So you 'd use that data to give you sort of what the   the true mappings are for each phone ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "I see ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Yeah . So wh yeah , where this fits into the rest in  in my mind , I guess , is that um  we 're looking at different ways that we can combine  uh different kinds of  of rep front - end representations  um in order to get robustness under difficult or even , you know , typical conditions . And part of it , this robustness , seems to come from  uh multi - stream or multi - band sorts of things and Saul seems to have  a reasonable way of looking at it , at least for one    one um articulatory feature . The question is is can we learn from that  to change some of the other methods we have , since  I mean , one of the things that 's nice about what he had I thought was that  that it  it um  the decision about how strongly to train the different pieces is based on uh a  a reasonable criterion with hidden variables rather than  um just assuming  that you should train e e every detector uh with equal strength  towards uh it being this phone or that phone .

It 's a soft \" AND \" , I guess but in  in principle  you  you wanna get a strong concurrence of all the different things that indicate something and then he \" OR 's \" across the different  soft \" OR 's \" across the different uh  multi - band channels . And um  the weight yeah , the target for the training of the \" AND \"  \" AND ' ed \" things  is something that 's kept  uh as a hidden variable , and is learned with EM .

I mean we ha we have a kind of  iterative training because we do this embedded Viterbi , uh so there is some something that 's suggested , based on the data but it 's  it 's not  I think it s doesn't seem like it 's quite the same , cuz of this  cuz then whatever  that alignment is , it 's that for all  all bands ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Well no , that 's not quite right , we did actually do them separate  tried to do them separately so that would be a little more like what he did .

Um  so I wanted to do this experiment to see um  uh what happens if we try to uh improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task and see how that affects things .

One of the first things I thought of was the fact that they use  the same number of states for all of the models"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "and so I went on - line and I uh found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "and just looked at , you know , the number of phones in each one of the digits . Um you know , sort of the canonical way of setting up a  an HMM system is that you use  um three states per phone and um  so then the  the total number of states for a word would just be , you know , the number of phones times three . And so when I did that for the Italian digits , I got a number of states , ranging on the low end from nine to the high end , eighteen . Um .  Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there 's an initial null and a final null so when they use  uh models that have eighteen states , there 're really sixteen states . They 've got those initial and final null states . And so um   their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits , the four and five  which um , according to my , you know , sort of off the cuff calculation , should have eighteen states each ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "And so they had sixteen . So that 's pretty close . Um   but for the  most of the words are sh much shorter . So the majority of them wanna have nine states . And so theirs are s sort of twice as long . So  my guess  uh And then if you  I  I printed out a confusion matrix um  uh for the well - matched case , and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best . So my guess about what 's happening is that  you know , if you assume a fixed  the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really um have , you know , half as much training data for those models .

Lots of silence ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Yeah , yeah . And so the S P model , which is what they put in between digits , I  I haven't calculated that for that one yet , but um .
