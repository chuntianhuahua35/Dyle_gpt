Right . Um . So just to kick off the meeting basically um so we're working now for a real reaction , this is uh so it  right . Just got an agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting . Um  We're gonna just do a quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another um then we're gonna start  talk a little bit about tool training . Essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet , the whiteboard .  Um  we've got a general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion close up . Um I  guess you know game or something um  in real life um so yeah basically I want to  I'm just gonna  you got  of course you can discuss that , I'm thinking about um  uh proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask , don't tell .

And that's the same for your when we do introductions I mean um and you talk about your background you know have fun , you know maybe you went to um  uh you know maybe i you're like in Maine you went to U_C_S_B_ but you wanna say you went to Harvard or something like that , why not , you know"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "you can  this is you know I guess we can have a little bit of fun with it .

Cool . So I guess that that  we're totally  we're making a remote control which is thrilling"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "um uh but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model I dunno if you guys had time to check the  in real life I dunno if you guys uh  checked the um  uh the corporate website . Um we've got to make something as fashionable as possible , that's kind of the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice you know like John Lewis nice or you know if you go to Debenham's or something . So um basically we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly um slick sleek kind of way .  Um way we're gonna go about doing that is basically at first we're gonna start on the basics . And that's where I'm gonna need you guys the User Interface Designers and the um  um the other designer that I can't remember ,"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "the the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ right um  the Industrial Designer"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "hey right on alright ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "getting into it um"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "There you go ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "to guide me and guide us on this project 'cause you're gonna be  you're g you guys are the bottom you know you're like no you can't do that you can't have you know X_ and Y_ um at the same time . And then um we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good , you know like um  I I think you guys probably got the same emails I did but the idea of um , yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand , or something like that . Um and so we'll work up from there and um then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me  tell us what's possible and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go take the the the take the basics and make it nicer and then ov obviously uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible um to try t of sync it all up . So that's the detailed design . So it's a three stage kind of thing . Um right so for now just for th the white board um basically uh just to get used to it , I haven't tried it yet either um I'm just gonna start and um mm carry like five remotes around um and just write down  I'm just gonna write down one of the names of my um desert discs you know if you  if you were trapped on a desert island and you could only bring five C_D_s along with you name one of them that you could , not all five , if you wanna write all five go for it but name one of them that you could um .

Um mm basic and um so I need you to tell us what um  we  what the user's gonna want ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "What they're looking for ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So actually in a way you guys c maybe in our next meeting chat a bit about what the user's gonna want and what the user can have , you know like uh so "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "And negotiate that . Uh ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "yeah well it is  and we'll discuss the trade-offs in between um so yeah specific instructions will be sent in your email . But I think that that is more or less a good place to start for now um and as more things come up we'll have meetings and you'll get emails and so forth . Um any questions , before we get started ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I assume that we're building a stand alone uh remote control , we can't kind of build it into other uh products ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": " You mean to like "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "For instance like a mobile phone or something like that ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm . Sounds interesting ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Hmm .  Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "I don't think there's any rules about it yet . So "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Maybe our personal coach will have something to say about that ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Or or you know can we produ can we sell a remote control phone for twenty five pounds or less ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Well , have a think about it ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "I mean"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yep . Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "I'm I'm certainly op it seems like yeah it it seems like it's certainly do-able"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "W yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "isn't it . I mean um or if we can't have a full mobile phone maybe a remote that has some other kind of  useful function ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "The clapper . No I mean "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "no , good idea , good idea .

Hot . "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "I like the little cover thingies ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Uh-huh y I like that "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . That's true , I guess we we probably have some time , maybe we should brainstorm a bit like what we wanna do , go back to um  I don't really have any . Let me bring up something about our basic goals here , what we want to accomplish . Uh project announcement . Ts ts ts    Yeah . Not so much ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "All right we'll find them , we're on our own ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Now are we also discussing kind of our initial ideas at all here ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah yeah let's do it , let's do ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "S does anybody have any initial ideas ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "I'm gonna go ahead and take notes on this too 'cause "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Good idea . Start your minutes . Um "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah I mean oh yeah right .  So initial ideas . "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Well it's pretty much given it's gonna be universal"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "right , we decided that already and it may be functioning for other things , as soon as you said that I was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do , like your microwave or your front door"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "or like to have everything on one thing ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "but then , I've never been a fan of those huge remotes that have like a million buttons ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "S smaller's better ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "you can't tell what they do ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Simple ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "But  I'm thinking  I'm thinking kind of P_D_A_ uh design"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah . Specific ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "so touch screen design rather than button"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Oh right . That'd be different ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Interesting ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": " Yeah that's slick"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "isn't it .

Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Um and we also "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Right .

Let's see ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I think , making it out of a nice material would be very important , because so many of those remotes that you see , these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah .

And also the bleep , when  what I told you about uh when you lost it , and you push a button , and then you hear bleep bleep , and we will find it . This is uh just uh "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Oh oh . Two questions ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "The battery . You say one battery is cheaper . Why ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "If we w if we use only just one uh small pen-light , then it will be cheaper than when we use two ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah but when you use two , you can use it two times longer ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah but then we'll have to make the um remote control uh long lasting ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay so it's the size of the remote control ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": " Just  Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay and the buttons . When you use it on the television , you've  you need the television , wh which can use it ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah . But uh I think this  our remote control is for the televisions we uh we sell in our company ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Or is it also for other company  uh for other televisions ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "I think we have to use it also on other televisions though ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Then this is an option . "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions . And then we make it easier uh for our televisions . And on the other tele televisions , you can also use it , but then we won't use the"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah but I don't  I think it   They are two different things though . We have to choose one . It has to work on o uh all televisions ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ? Okay . Then I think uh the menu button uh will only work on the newer televisions . And we will uh look forward and don't make a remote control which for the older televisions ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "And I just uh have one more idea . Uh maybe it's one of your tasks . But  Uh , to have a trendy remote control , we can also um make something like the Nokia um mobile phones . To change covers . So if you have uh a trendy half with all red , uh yellow and something . And then you can put a red cover on it ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "And also different things ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . Good idea ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yes ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Will this will this add to the cost ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Uh then it won't be  uh will have just one cover on the uh original one . And then you can buy the covers ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yes but you have to m uh be able to change it . D does it make it more difficult to design ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I think it will be a little more difficult , but not too much ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Not much . 'Kay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Just like with the Nokia uh mobile phones ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah but there are much more Nokia telephones than um these ones ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Just one ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah but then we'll have to to just um put five covers on it , and see if it works . If it won't works then we'll get something else . Then we uh won't g uh go further with it ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah but are their profits bigger than their cost ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Uh a p a   a cover made in uh in China , it it won't be I guess so expensive I think ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah but there are also design cost . I don't think  When you have a remote control , do you change the cover ? Would you change the cover ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Maybe . I wi I won't ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "No ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "But maybe I think trendy people or like children where you can paint on it , and uh the the children think , oh this is my remote control , uh I made a picture on it . Uh "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "N yeah but  I think that too less people would change it for good profit . So "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah . Okay . And the other people ? What do you think about it ? "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Um "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah it's a good idea .

Uh  Come on .  . Ah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yes well uh uh I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": " Um I thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh  for a remote control to to to have some influence on the tv set . Uh both audio and vide video uh in a cordless way . No cords attached . And uh well , it all by pushing a button on the remote . That was from my own experience and uh and uh the previous meeting . Uh I find some uh some interesting quotes on the web . Uh well the same idea here . Uh message to the television . And uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off , and uh switching channels , and uh  and maybe uh teletext or something like that . Uh well these are two uh remotes , and that's our uh our dilemma I think . Uh  We just heard from the Industrial Designer how uh difficult it is . But uh shall we make a basic remote control , uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more . Or uh uh more functions on the remote . Uh maybe more devices you can influence . Uh a radio or a v a video recorder , uh V_C_R_ .  Yeah well that's our dilemma . Um any ideas about that ? Basic or multifunctional ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "We'll got back on that later ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay yeah . Yeah well the  that was just on my mind ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yes ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So uh I didn't know what uh what way we would go . Mm yeah well that was my uh functional uh talk  ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "'Kay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "'Kay , thank you . Then it's your turn , the marketing expert ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay . Uh um m Yeah .  Um yeah okay . This bit too far . "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "So  So I'm uh gonna have a presentation about um the market , about um yeah what people think . Uh we did a usability lab-test with a hundred persons . And we looked at uh several um things . Uh among them design , uh d d how d did they like the use of it , uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls . Uh well what what will be our market . And uh we asked them if we had some new featu features . If um that would be a good idea or not . Well our findings . Uh our users , they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls . Um uh they especially found found them very ugly . And um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it . Uh well they also zap a lot . So uh zapping uh should be very easy . And uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons . So a lot of unused buttons . There is more findings . Uh on the buttons . Which uh buttons find users uh very important and which which not ? And how much would they use them ? Well uh the most used button is the channel selection . And uh we asked them how uh relevant they think uh the buttons are . The power , volume and channel selections are very relevant . Uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important . Uh not important they found the audio , uh that's not the volume but uh specific the the pitch , or the left or right . Uh the screen and the brightness . And uh channel settings . Uh th and they also are not used very often . Then we have a few um graphs about the market . Uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups . Um as you can see , most users are uh between thirty six and forty five . Um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big . And to come back on the the swapping uh things , uh I don't think uh , I  I think the younger will be most interest in it . But uh they are not a very big group . Um in the  we asked them , uh how would you like a s a new feature . If you have an lcd on the remote control , what would you think of it . Now you can clearly see young users say  . I will  that would very nice . And older user think uh they will be scared of change  I think ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "And they won't like it . And another thing , how would you like to have a speech recognition on it . Well here we see the same . Young users uh think that's an interesting idea . And old users not . Uh well we uh found out that there are two  several markets at which we can aim . Uh the first are the younger , the age between sixteen and forty five . Uh they are highly interested in the features , as you can see uh here . And um they are more critical on their money spending . Uh the second group is the older group . Aged between forty six and sixty five . They are less interested in uh new features . But uh they spend their money more easily . Now if we look back at this graph , we can see that among the first group is about um sixty percent . And the second group about forty percent . So the the first group is bigger . Well then I come to my uh personal preferences . Uh yeah the first question is uh  also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at . Uh of course n uh saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that old people won't buy it . But less of them will buy it . Um well I uh   Okay . What I thought , um even young people say it's hard to use , remote control . So if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use , that's especially aimed at this group , even uh the young group will also be more interested . And um we can make special features . But uh I think it looks nice in the first time . But when use it , uh I don't know what's uh good thing of speech recognition ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Um well th uh that's my second point ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Uh less important functions should be discarded from the remote control . It's about discussion we had earlier . Um  You can find most functions on a tv set . So uh you don't have to have a lot of audio options , or screen options to change the brightness . And such things . Um well the design is very important . One thing I did not say I think , is that a lot of users also said then I would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one . But they found most remote controls very ugly . So the design of our remote control is very important . And uh yeah it should be very zap friendly , as most users use it for that . That were my findings ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay thank you ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah . I have uh one question ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yes ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "If we aim for the younger people , um and there will be uh a lot of features like lcd or the the the speech uh f recognising , uh the cost will be a lot of h uh a lot higher ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Uh I think we don't have that in our budget ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yes ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "No ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Do you think ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "No ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "And I don't uh I don't think twenty five Euros for a remote is really cheap or something ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Like  No . No ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So it's  Yeah , it's hard to uh get the younger group ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Uh-huh ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "I think uh the lcd is cheaper than speech recognition .

I can go first ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "You wanna go first ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay . Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay , so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "I assume we just pull it out ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "  Right . Um  so f from the "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? Once we  you don't have to do it now but when  once you go back ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay , yeah , afterwards , yeah , okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Right sure ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "just so that I don't have to scribble everything down ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Uh okay .   So n uh with uh with regard to the  uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh I've identified um  a few basic uh components of the remote and uh  se uh from the design , functional design perspective um w I c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other .   So   this is the method that uh I'll mostly be following in my um  in my uh role . Um the identification of the components , uh and uh since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and  uh from the user interface person . Uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "and uh basically update and come up with a new design , so it's a cyclical process .  Okay , so  these were the basic findings from today . The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email . Uh I just quickly jotted them down . Um  so basically uh the  as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um  and how the parts uh communicate with each other . Um  okay , so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control . Um also uh the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex . And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television . How however , our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the  the use for television ,  in order to keep things simple . Um  also the management wants that um our design should be unique uh it  so  it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard .  Okay , so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control . Um  there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface . The user interf interface communicates with the chip , so  I'll basic go over to the  Okay .  So  if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell , uh it communicates  uh it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything . There is a user interface here .  So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal , um which then  so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code , which is then communicated  to the remote site , which h has an infrared receiver . Um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating . Um so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control , whatever new functions that we need to do , um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger , basically ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": " Okay .  Um so  i in my personal preferences um  I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . This would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time . And uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design , so that our um  uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most uh televisions .  That's about it .

Okay , let's start from the beginning . So I'm going to speak about technical functions design uh just like some  some first issues that came up . Um 'kay , so the method I was um adopting at this point , it's not um for the for the whole um period of the um  all the project but it's just at th at this very moment ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Um uh my method was um to look at um other  um remote controls , uh so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what um functionality they used . And then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh functionalities .  And yeah , and then just to um  put the main function of the remote control in in words ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Um so the findings uh were  um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set , so this quite straightforward . And uh w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off , uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels , or then mm  uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers . And and also the volume is very important . Um  um  I als"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": " Sorry , cou could you go back for a second ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Uh switching on off channel , uh volume ,  okay , that's great ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "'Kay . Um um among the findings I found that m m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm  functionalities um in their design , like operating a V_C_R_ , but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players , but then  there are  surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them , but according to the last minute update um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size . And then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something . Um then   yeah , the must-have buttons would be on off and then  the channel numbers and then um  the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel , and then volume has to be there . But then um other functionalities um  could be just  uh there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then , um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um  done through the menu . And yeah , the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n uh more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minute update ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So at the  for the time being that's uh that's all ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "If you have questions "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "If  I mean that was the the directive that came through from management , but if we had a a decent case for  that we really think it's important to include video and D_V_D_ , I could get back to them and see . It's w it's just whether it's worth arguing about ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , and also it's it's um  other question is uh because there are so many different  And there are so many different things that could possibly be included"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "because besides video and D_V_D_ there are the mm um video C_D_s and whatever , so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah .

Don't forget about that . So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . And next please . Yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . First of all , they find it very ugly .  Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , and they're not l good looking . Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were  people are ready to pay for nice and look  and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in  and effort in that um . And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it  the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using .

One of the thing  the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility  the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want .

"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah . Uh as you know , I am mister Ramaro . I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices and I previously devised many uh  like digital calculators and electronic calculators .  So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control . Well , as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like tv or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera . So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like tv . So we need to have some energy source to do what  to do the functions , what we want on this portable device .  And usually this  so to do these functions we need an interface , which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that . And then these messages  these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device . It's generally in the form of infrared or some kind of s sensor information . Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want . So , basically we need uh since we are focusing on our interface device  remote control mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want , and then we have some chip , it's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are  I am one doing mostly digital uh devices we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format . And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source which sends the information to the main device . Then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations , and we ought to do different codes for different tvs ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "so some tvs will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay . To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah yeah , because the people don't use one particular brand so"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "or at least we have more more than five brands , which are really good ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So we need to check their specifications and do their uh encryption that's passing information to the tv device . So we need to have particular encryption codes ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Then , components , so we have the main uh energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared uh source and then we have some inside some chip in in the device . Uh since I don't have much time so I'll input the connections to all this components . And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm .

Yeah , I'm sure , because since our User Interface  speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "so"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "we can have another , like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Since we have some kind of uh energy this is our this normal battery , so this battery , once you s switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "On "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Uh train it , okay .

No uh yes . Okay , so I'm going to talk about trends and um I hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control . So , next slide please . So first maybe just a small recap on  how how do we watch trends so it's not so uh simple you might think that it's easy but uh it's not so simple . Anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know , so have to to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing , and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which basically is a small device that people  have with them , always , like a phone . We can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh  example of where to in be inspired . Of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also  have also to be inspired because in fact they're not only watching the trends , they're inventing it , they're creating the trend . I hope I'm going to try to help you on that . This is more risky because you're not following the trend ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": " "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "you try to invent it , which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you don't and you're out of business .

Uh to be to be quick  there's a lot of words here but uh basically there are  uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very  pay much attention to . The first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel . And uh interestingly this is the very most important thing . It has to be fancy . Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important , which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control . So as you see uh  it first have to be very nice , s something that people are proud of uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends , huh , mine has this and not yours . And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control .

If we look back and not uh look at only remote controls I think it's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas so  currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan , well , it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of  of look or feel"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": " "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": " "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "or so .

Wow ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "and uh  the the lcd and and the scroll are inside . Um well , everything else is probably user interface , so . Yeah , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "And it's  the whole thing's made of rubber , is that "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Uh yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": " Oh yeah . Yeah , it has , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Rubber ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ,  .

Is that right ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yes , I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm dots , never mind ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay . But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "  I guess we'll give it maximum points in everything . "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , the yeah , it's definitely attractive .

Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Actually this bottom red ring here just unclips"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "and then you put a a new a new uh a new plate on top of that ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "And the whole thing "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So I mean there are  I "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Right"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "we definitely priced out a spongy  even spongier non-natural look um materials"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah .

I like it , brilliant .  Um ,  what we need to discuss now is the finance of it , um I got me  you've got  you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice .

Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Clever , clever , well done .

It's just making use of the same space and the same materials ,"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay . Um and the case , it's more of a single-curved case , I guess would be that  be the general "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , one big curve I guess you could say ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": " Um and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout .

Okay , um , basically I was just evaluating um  from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of  these are the things we needed to do , these are the things that look like we feel they're important . Um so I was looking at basic design things , does it fulfil its functions as a remote ? Is the design what we wanted it to do ? I are technologies up to where we hoped they would be and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for ? Um .

Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Wo wo wood ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Did you say wool ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Wood , wood ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Wood .

Um the "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Huh ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "so uh we can use even um  a certain titanium is also used uh in the company to make uh  uh some space design equipment , so it's kind of um uh it'll be probably nicer to use , because it relates to the overall image of the company , but uh it cannot be used on a double curved surface .

And then , I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also . First uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours . Like , totally yellow , totally red . Uh , so it's visible . Uh , the shapes are curved and round , like uh you also said . Maybe it's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones , straight and uh flat and long . But to give him the shape of your hand , so you  it's easier to use or something like that . But that's just an idea . And then , I'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control . The battery , there are few options . Uh , I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery . So , everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket . Or use uh a k uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch . When you uh shake it a few times , it it's loaded . Uh , the the form of the remote control , I think it's also nice  have it curved . And maybe like it's hand-shaped . Uh , so uh you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons . Uh material , you use plastic . Hard plastic uh because uh  it won't have to burst uh like in the  in one time . And also rubber because the younger people like that , what we see in the research . Uh the push-buttons . We have one new thing uh discovered . It's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse . Maybe it's uh easy to use uh for the channels . When you want to go m move up , you just scroll up and click on the button , if you wanna see the next , uh if you wanna see that channel . And also for the mouse , uh for the volume , it's also uh easy to use . Just scroll a bit up , scroll a bit down . And that's also easy just w when you have a thing like this , and you get it here . You can do it with your thumb . And with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "uh if you  push uh channel one , you can see channel one . The electrics um with a scroll push uh button , we must use regular uh chips . There are also uh simple chips . They are uh cheaper . Um , but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control , and I think there are a lot of those uh things , and people won't buy it any more . They have seen enough of it . And you have also advanced um chips . But that's with the lcd uh screen . And the costs will increase a lot more . And I think our budget is too low to use and an lcd , and the chip who is more expensive . And maybe it's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the  for remote control , that we then use the primary colours . Like , you get a yellow uh remote control , red one , blue one , et cetera . You have any more questions about this ? I think the main thing is we look at the costs ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yep ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "And not too basic , not a basic remote control , who everybody already has ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah .

So no  we're not doing D_V_D_ , we're not doing anything else ,"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "it's just gonna be a television remote .  Um it also needs to have the company colours included in it ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": " Um so that's red and black . And it has to have the slogan , case you guys forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics . Um and no teletext . I'm not sure what teletext is but I'm assuming you guys do , so we don't wanna include that um in this particular design .  For reasons that I don't really know . There's  but it's the board so there you go . So basically um given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later I mean 'cause it's television only we'll be able to change our uh  um well we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote .  Anyway . So I'm gonna turn over to the Industrial Designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation on "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay . So do I unplug this bit here ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Oh , right yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Gotta plug you in ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yep . Might have to hit function F_ eight but it looks like it's gonna come up . Yep . Cool ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay . Right . That's page one of my presentation ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Brilliant ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Very nice . For your first PowerPoint it's lovely ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So the uh method . We're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project . Um remote control works as follows . This is all pretty basic stuff you guys . Um sends message to another system , so there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines , there's an integrated circuit , which is the microchip , um and that actually compose the messages and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system . A user interface controls the chip , basically that's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well . So my findings , um I just did a preliminary study here and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands . And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals . Um too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like , and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer , just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": " 'Kay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction . Um , components . Just some ideas that I had , um , energy source , it's kinda hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup . Um the user interface , I was  since we can't use metal I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "The chip , um , silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that , we can't really be different in that respect . Um , the sender well I'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard , multi channel , that's a word I made up , I don't really know what it means ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "'Kay . Fair enough ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Uh PAL and N_T_S_C_ compatible and uh probably a two hundred foot range ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "'Kay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Uh and the receiver of course is any number of electronic devices . Um but in this case it'll only be tvs . Um personal preferences , I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal , um , the company simply can't afford this kinds of lawsuits"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Fine ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": " Is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers , or mo modern types of plastics"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "'cause we were thinking "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value um like if a white  like if we talk about like well like on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "It needs , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "you can do i is there some kind of nice colo der quality plastic that we can work with ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah that shouldn't be a problem . Um for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay , okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": " That's the end of my presentation ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Cool ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Great . Thank you very much Nathan .  Um if next we can have the um User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "S plug yourself in here . Mm .  Um hit function F_ eight real quickly , hold down  Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Looks like you're in okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Is it plugged in well ? There it goes . Computer adjusting ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Th"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "There you go . Sweet ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "There you go ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Well so . Here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation . Um so a few of the requirements we need here . Uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device , it needs to be universal um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices although we now uh find that uh that that's no problem ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah sorry I couldn't get that g to use before ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Um so some of my findings . Um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set . Um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television , uh switch to the next channel , that sort of thing , I think we're all quite uh quite uh intelligent and know know what a normal remote control does . Um  now some of the other things I found is a a complicated remote control sorry that we can't quite see my red there very well"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Oh yeah look at that ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm . "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "but uh this remote control has many functions um so it can do a lot of things but it uh it is quite complicated"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "and most users will find it uh find that they won't use most of the functions because they don't know how to use them and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do it . As you also notice it's quite a boring design . Um . Another remote control , slightly different , it's a simpler remote control uh many less buttons but uh has many fewer functions , um m much easier for the user to manipulate and use . Um it also has a bit of a cheap look and it's also quite boring .

Just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple face but it's uh  ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Great . Thanks for that Ron ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": " 'Kay"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Does that mean I'm up ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "yep that's you ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "I think so . Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I can plug you in ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Oh that would be perfect . Thank you . Slide show up and running ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Give it a little bit ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Or not . Uh . Oh there we go . Perfect . Okay . So this is me . Um basically I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort  like watching a hundred people  use tv remotes and see what it is that they're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general tv remote control practices . Um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time , everybody's used to using changing the channel , turning it on , using the volume , m the majority of the time that's all that's going on , the other functions happen , for some people they're important , but the primary uses are really really basic . Um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use , they're not using a lot of it , they don't need it , they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with .  And um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people , their  the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it . And then they can't find it in the room . So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something , will really come into play with a lot of these people .  Um there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful , and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options . I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically , that's up to the design people , but it is s something worth thinking about , especially since the younger demographic's obviously the one that's gonna keep growing , so if that's the direction we're headed in it's something to think about . Um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice , which are the standards .  So it's a good start for us ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": " That's great . Thank you Sarah . Right . So um"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Need to unplug this ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "yep I'll just uh switch that back here ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Need it back ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "I'll finish up with just a bit of discussion plan on for the next phase ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "There you go ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": " Right so I think we've covered most of these important questions through this um  through you guys's presentations um  we've got uh y the Industrial Designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic .  Um Sarah , she's recommended that we go for simpler functions , so fewer functions um but we need to decide who are we selling this to , you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted , thought about voice control ,"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Oh right ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": " um so do we wanna go for that , or do we want to go for an older demographic , and my thought is  um  we've got w if we're gonna go for a sleek look I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics  um .

Uh next sheet ? Um at first I tell you something about what people dislike about the current uh controls , because it's uh a smart thing to exclude those things . Uh , furthermore it's very important what they do like and what they do use .  Um then I tell something about um the most important issues . So we have to focus on those three thing three things . And in the end I'll um show you our target  audience or our target product users , customers . Well ,  um the first findings are that people um think most controls are very kind of ug ugly ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "That's seventy five per cent of the current users . They don't like it , so we might think about fronts in that section . Um  They also say , that's about uh I thought it was fifty per cent , uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls . So it's very important that you design a a nice looking control .  Um the current user uses his machine just about well all of the time for a few functions . Uh , almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity . So it's really important to make the the buttons for the common uh tasks kind of big or kind of uh flashy . Furthermore , it's uh  seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot . Thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": " You can zap away . Yeah . "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah , yeah right ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Right .

Alright ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "And uh the source is of course the user .

Uh we  "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "No no , but  Yeah . Exactly .

Uh ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "You see ? So we must build in something , or they will to uh go to the concurrent ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": " Competitors .

"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Those kind of things , uh because you also have those uh those program recognition for your V_ V_C_R_s .

Yeah right ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah . Yeah .

Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ,"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "I think it should be at the top ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "something like on um some radios in car .

At the top ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Shouldn't we start with the most important parts ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yes ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "At the top or at the bottom ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "The lcd screen alright  but we should start with the power button ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "I think the top is more uh "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Uh "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah but "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "When you s How do you zap ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "You just sit in your chair ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Huh ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah but with with the lcd screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "With the remote ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "That thing is terrible ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "'Cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom .

Why do you think it's better at the bottom ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Uh well because most uh remotes have um some space left at the bottom , and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "But your "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I c"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "But you just can put uh the the the the the whole interface a bit down , so that there's room for the for the interface ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Well I d I think that's that's ugly but "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "The the ticker  The lcd is like like small .

Power button always  Yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Bottom ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So and and I I like to use the ones on the top ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , y you gotta zap like this or  you want to  Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So when I u when I have to have an lcd s scr window "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah right . But  We're making a remote with  with a few functions you know ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Well  that's  a bit exaggerated . Well , I agree with you  . It's it's also more recognisable ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "We"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "It looks more like a calculator to people , if you have the l the the the thing on top .
