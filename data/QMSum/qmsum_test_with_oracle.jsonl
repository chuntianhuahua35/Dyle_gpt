Um "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "But that's that's only for the buttons ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "I I guess if we leave the  if we leave this one out , um "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So the button we can use plastic ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "oh . "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "And uh maybe not use the special form ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "And the pla uh  And a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas uh instead of rubber ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "But it "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": " It becomes a very dull remote control , I know ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yes ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "But it's the board decision . Um  And um  yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Well , b basically it   when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , because I think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . Yeah , I know . Maybe we should look at an  uh focus on another uh "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So  Type of m maybe another market segment ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , m uh maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy uh uh um basic"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "and uh m maximise the profits"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yes ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "and um "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "That's  maybe that's better . "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Maybe we could uh  we should go for straight and simple ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "but that's not what uh has been asked ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "I know , I know ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So we should kick the board's uh   Well "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": " Yeah . Although I think we  yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yes ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Um but uh I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device . Definitely not , no .  It's not that innovative ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Or however you s pronounce that ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , too bad . "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Um so , okay .  Um  Oh ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "this is the wrong one . So uh that means redesign .  We do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Um  but we can evaluate the process and um uh uh the satisfaction on how things went . Um I'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first . I guess "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Um well , since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway  "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , that's true ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Well , maybe it's good to do it anyway , because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "We l we can learn . Yeah . Yeah . I agree ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Well "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Is it fancy ? "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "I d it is it is  "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Uh "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yay . Is it ? Is it fancy ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , I think so ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Um the yellow rubber , I think so ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I think so ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": " You like the rubber , uh Roo . "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": " I'm into it . "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "So uh one ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "But it's not that fancy ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "No , I'll I'll I'll give it a two ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I mean I think uh  I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing  the casing . It would be even more "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "You like tita "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "oh , you really like titanium . I'm I'm into it . "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "That's a flavour as well ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "It has flavour .

Um "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , I know ,"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Is it uh "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "but but it  but that's fancy in the way um   I mean fancy has has a lot of "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "It has to do with fashion , I guess ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "It's trendy trendy , fun  "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So do "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "And w"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "yeah , w what they want  wanted was uh colours and soft materials ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "So in that way  It  it's fancy ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "It applies . It  yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Well , just  give it a two ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yes ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "It's not the ultimate uh fancy two , but "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I think I th I think it would have been  I would have think  uh it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case .

It's okay . We did   yes , we did good ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay , and uh was it innovative ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Well ,"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "with the voice recognition feature and uh "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "But that's not in it . Ov or can we "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yep ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "No , we are evaluating this this uh design now . This prototype ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Well , let's let's  this product ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So I I I think it is . I think it's innovative ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": " And the scroll uh wheel . The solar  not many remotes have the solar , I think ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "No . It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , but it's it's way too "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah , and uh "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "That would have been a thrill ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "yes , but "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "So uh also a uh two ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I think uh it's a two ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yep ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Is it easy to use ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "I'm not sure .  I'm not sure ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think . Well , hard  it's not for the for the e for the elderly . They won't use it ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": " Well , but there are two parts in this remote control . What you see here is is the basic part . Everybody can use it , so that's easy to use ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "That's for a novice user . When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . So in that in that way it is advanced ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I think  I think a three ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So uh  It's maybe  it's not very uh easy for "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": " Wouldn't give it more ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Uh I'm doubting  doubting as well . Um "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Well the p the most important function is easy to use . The the zapping , channel switching , volume . But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay . Uh two or three ? Three ? Wha wh what would be your guess ? I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "It's the uh it's it's overall . Is the device easy to use ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , that's right . You're right in that , but I   I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "because he is already  he or she is already an advanced user ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Um  Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "After all , I think  personally I would give a two . But "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Uh Roo , a three ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yep ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Ruud ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Good question . Uh I'll go uh for the two ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay . "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So , it's two , two and three . Two threes . So that's ten ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So I could make it e easy ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "If you make it a four it will be three in general ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So that's w No , two and a half ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "If he makes it a four . Not a three ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Six and four . Six and four is ten . Divided by four is two and a half . So "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Darn . Nee ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yes . "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Hmm ? Huh ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Roo . "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "A seven , a three   No ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah . I yeah  ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "A four and a three together ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": " Four ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , you have a two , he has a two . Three ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Two ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "two , two , three "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "No ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "And a three ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "I haven't said anything yet ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Nee . I know ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "No . "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay , but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . Divided by four is two point five ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Divided by four ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yes . So if you want to have the conclusion as a three  three . Then you would make a four .

Because we compare all these uh characteristics  characteristics with uh market  uh with with the real market ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy . They're out there .

What do you give it ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Well yeah , it depends , 'cause it's the most spongy we could "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , I know , but you have to name a fig uh a number . "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "but  yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Because we need to go on  in  for the time ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Well , if I give it a one there'll be one hell of a calculation ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "It will be a one .

I believe it's  If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features , I don't I don't think it is  it has all the features um a normal remote has ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "I think it has ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . Bec because you can um  we didn't talk about it , but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal .

At at least uh forty buttons ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to .

It's "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . Okay , um let's give it a number . I'll give it uh a one . For for the  for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I'll give a two ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": " Yeah , I'll give it a one ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Um I think think a one , 'cause  v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want , so that's like um "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yes .

Yes , but you can you c Yes , but you can learn this thing , all these functions ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "And it's easier to use because those uh remote controls don't offer voice recognition"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": " ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "and this one does ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So I think it's worth its price ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay .

In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . Um , the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about . Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , they don't like the way they feel , they don't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and I think we should design according to these buttons . Easy to lose , and R_S_I_ . I don't know what R_S_I_ means . Um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , I don't have a clue ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Hm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . They're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . And um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order . Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . The other ones are the settings , and they're used less than  you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . Um , about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . And if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , I don't really know how to describe this , um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing . Um I don't I don't know um what the decision to be made is , but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , but we should discuss this together .

Um  so I think things like uh you know keeping buttons together that  like close together that um  are used in the same way , uh  or um maybe that making 'em the same colour , keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum , and also things like is it is it um is it uh  can you c y small enough large enough I'm not sure we c I guess we would need to do some research about , I would , about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing , um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the tv . Does it have like capacity to change the channels ? Um  does it do  or do we need to have like functions for cable or V_C_R_ ? And then , is it findable , and uh how do we wanna do that ? And um   I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , um I dunno if this will work but  And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those .  Just I mean I like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , uh but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like um  like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user .  That concludes my presentation ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay . You need the little thingy . Ooh ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "How do I um "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "S That's on view ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Oh ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , um and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting . Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the tv . And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the tv and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , um input which would probably be buttons , although um we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , um something to transmit it to the tv , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . And also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their tv or stick it on their wall . And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . Power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the tv . And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the tv which would output some sort of signal , um we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up . Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source , that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , um a button pad for input , um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the tv , that's just sort of standard , um so most tvs have an I_R_ receiver . Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself .

So volume could be like the top it and the bottom  So do you need to "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Doesn't it rotate though ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "so it'll be moving around ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "What do you mean the function ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I mean like okay , 'cause so  I dunno , I guess  Okay  so when you g scroll your thumb like around it , it'll s like say you're go you're going clockwise . That that means you're gonna go up the channels , and then you scroll the other way and it'll go down ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "But then "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "so if you wanna switch to the  to u do you have to switch to a function where like y so you're either in that mode or you're in the mode where like it just has like the four like you know this is channel that way , that's that way and volume is up and down ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah but it knows for some reason ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "It just "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "The iPod knows ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "It just kno  the iPod knows .

The cost "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Twelve , twelve a half ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , I think for the cost we want  for the cost we want   it's better to have uh uh Let's see . Yeah . You can move to the next slide , so . So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , so here for example the infrared bulb will be here"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "and the bulb it will be somewhere inside ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "That might just  So ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "You can go to the next slide ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I have some kind of pictures you know , here .

"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": " You'd  yes , you can . It's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know , put some energy inside , so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise , so .

We can have both also ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So you think that uh  a cable between the remote control  and the tv   won't be a good idea ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": " Okay . Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": " No it wou maybe it will be cheaper  I dunno , I just may maybe you making a solu"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "But this is what you would like to ask the user first and I don't think the user would be ready to have a "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": " Yeah ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": " Wireless remote control  ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "but "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "I don't think  well , yeah , I don't think he would ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , but some pa I always want to have you know ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "but in a sense "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "sometime I want to have wire because you know ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": " "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": " I'm just asking you .

True ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "I think it's more your problem . Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Uh that's my job . That's the "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": " Okay ,  I'm sorry ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Now the "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah but , it should be an agreement , you know , because  even if you can think of the wireless , it is it's it is the job of the  the the g Graphical User Designer , but you know . If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have , if you want to use ,  so  it can be good to have a wireless , it it is a question ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": " So"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "just think of um the usability ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Design a wireless remote control .

So just trying to answer all the questions , if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh . We've made a study , so could you go to next slide ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Sorry for the functional recurrence . So that's the standard method for marketing , okay . We had one hundred subjects , um , we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , um , and see what was okay or not for them ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay . So then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered . Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly , okay , so that's "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "You mean the loo the look , the outside ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "The look , how it look like ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah , the the look is is bad for them"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "so uh it's your job , David , maybe . Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly . So this is where we could have uh yeah , good market , I guess , if people are ready to pay more ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "So it's it's interesting information , I think . And then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so  doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , because it's too many buttons and so on . So we should change this as well . And uh users are actually zapping a lot , so they're using the device intensively , that's something to take into account as well . And um , you know , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control . And uh this is one of the main point for me . But I'll come back to it later . 'Kay . Could you go next slide ? Uh , so as you said uh ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "So this is from the experiments we've done ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": " "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , I think .

"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay ? So , those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count . So last slide .

Yeah ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , I think possible .

Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes .

Okay ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Then you you put the switch button ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "but "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "then it switch to another category of functions .

Well , um we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases . And these latex cases , there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source  source .

Good ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So I don't think we should use the dynamo thing . "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Kineti okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "The kinetic thing it  it's it's a possibility .

That's no different ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "But  Yes . And I think it's more robust ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "It's more uh Uh it's more functional ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "But what about um the markets  uh wants colourfuls uh designs ?

Okay . Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So I think this is the best of two worlds ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay , what about um  the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting ? Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue . Because it it's of cour"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yes .

Um  Basically I'm I'm not very technical uh uh educated , but uh I could figure it out . Um basically what happens is you press a button , uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button , uh like a switch . And by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed . So like you press a one , that circuit is closed and uh  Then the chip produces a pattern . Like a Morse code to uh  And and sends that to the uh L_E_D_ . That's the uh light emitting diode , I think . Um and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light . That's un uh invisible to the human eye . And uh transmit that uh to the tv . However it has also an uh a visible uh diode that's uh blinking red if you look in it .

I think we will save money with that ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay . Are you almost finished or just "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , the the personal preference , I didn't fill it out ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay . Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Because I was short on time ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "No worry ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "But um  Basically what we could do too is uh have a Bluetooth uh integration ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , I just want to talk some  about some more . So maybe you have to  Yeah ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So this  Oh , sorry . Wh what's that ? So uh  Oh , sorry . We have some new uh project requirements . We have to have a look what they are . They're still in um  Uh teletext has become outdated since the popularity of internet . So a teletext option , maybe we have to skip that one . I'm not sure . I don't think so ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "No ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "but "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "and I I think a lot of people use uh teletext , still use ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "No ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , and it's it's on your comp it's on your television . It's only one button . So I don't think it is "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Uh ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "We definitely should use it . Um "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , that's uh what I told you . The remote control should only be used for a television . So that's maybe easier . And um the the forty plus people , I already told you . Oh no , sorry . Oh , this is a problem . Oh sorry about that . The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty . So it should be flashy or just more interesting ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": " Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Oh . Mm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay , that's  It changes things ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "I'm sorry about that .

I think uh the thing in the dark is a good way ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "That still stays ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "to make it more like a mobile phone . More modern ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "That's important I think and "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "lcd doesn't work for uh twelve and a half Euros I think ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "And I d I don't don't think it's very usable in a remote control , especially when you only have tv functions on it ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Oh ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm ah  I I don't y you'll use it often , because you can see on the television wh what channel you "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Oh , I'm watching uh the channel one . Okay .  No , it's not "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": " Yeah , I tho I think that's not usable ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": " No ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So , but uh  Yeah . What other features can we put in ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah . I think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular . And uh then the usability is not that required , because the  Like in the mobile phones , usability is not that good I think ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "But uh some of you had uh something to read about um  uh speech uh recognition . About you said one and the television turns on one . Is that reachable maybe ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I didn't read "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "That's very  That's fancy . That's cool ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "It's very fashion ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I didn't read any"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Twelve and you've got twelve ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "b Yeah . Yeah okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I I know ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Only the numbers , only numbers .

I think so ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , and also if if you have a good speech uh speech recognition , you can just throw the uh "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah . A uh someone says that uh give me one Coke , and the tv turns uh to one ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "the remote away . Mm . Hmm . Mm .

It lights up all ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , that's right . You have to  Yeah , that's right . That's what I said . It's the same as the telephone . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay yeah . D Yeah , alright . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "And do we use a a  Uh what's it called ? Like a iMac ,  if you can look through it . Or just a normal remote control ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Maybe just as an option , w like we discussed , like iPod ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm , maybe it's a good idea ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Different colours , uh maybe use even different fonts ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Like uh phones ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Oh yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Different colours . Okay ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "so y you just make it th through  You look through it ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "A see-through . Mm , that's cool ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah . Uh as an option maybe ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay . And so the buttons we have , this is , yeah , this is normal . We put in the the simple buttons on the top ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "It's the standard "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "and probably the the the more complicated buttons down there ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , uh  Yeah ,"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "But you have  You had a lot of different buttons ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "we but we don't  We don't really have any complicated buttons ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , maybe you have you have to  Uh when you use teletec teletext , you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one , or to go to the previous one ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah okay , but  Yeah , well w I think the buttons are very easy . With just uh standard buttons we just have so little "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "O but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control . Because you ne almost never use it ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "No , I don't need don't need  Uh teletext options are only four buttons or something ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , but younger people I think um more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , that's right ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I use teletext as well ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So uh "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "No , I use te teletext every day , I think ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Hmm . Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . For me too , it is . So we just keep it one level then ? Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah yeah , one level . And I think , uh 'cause um we don't have that many buttons ,"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I think the design is most important . You can d uh integrate the buttons in the design very much ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "'Cause  simple buttons ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "If you put one above it , it's clear ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay .

Um  we have forty minutes . So it's now  Yep . Okay . Um the new project requirements , first of all , um we didn't speak about it , but we should not um support teletext in the remote , um because our b um board uh feels that uh teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext . So um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product .  It's a board decision . Um the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not uh f uh feasible , it's not uh w"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "uh uh  we we cannot make it because of the time to market um that we have to deal with ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Time , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Uh the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than uh forty ,  which is important for you , uh Ruud , and as well for uh Roo . Because the product should um be uh interesting and and uh should be bought by people younger than forty . Um  then for Roo , as well uh important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product . So the colour colours and the slogan um do have to be uh in the product ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yes ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Is that clear ? Any questions on these requirements ? No ?  Okay . Um the individual presentations , I th um Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , I'll start ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Uh uh yeah . Okay ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yes ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "great ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Um  Oh , how can I uh  Geez , and sli and show . Um  Just uh press it ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Uh yes . Alright . Um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion .  Uh the method of the remote control is just  the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . So that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities , but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": " Um but um  yeah . My personal preferences were ease of uh  the easy to use remote control , because uh the user-friendliness and uh  it can be more trendy in in user design .

Um well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a tv set . And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a tv set .

Can you see it ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "No , it's not visible ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "No ? Well  Um , there's a energy source here .  And um basically there  it's connected to three things . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using uh infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . That's basically the idea . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look .  Okay . Um what have I found . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . That's all . It's cased together , nothing more than that .  It's almost every piece of equipment um every piece of uh every tv set is controlled infrared ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "There are some exceptions , but most of all have uh infrared controls .

Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay . I have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented . Um basically this is all there is . There's just one chip . There are a few buttons connected . Uh the buttons are lit . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here .  So that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So it's fairly easy ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "There's nothing more to it . It's fairly easy .

Uh are there other things about the market we should know ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Um I think we dealt with the most important information .

This is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it I think it brings up the menu . And uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable . So you can change the colour , according to your  to suit your living room or whatever . And it comes "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "You could change the vegetable , or fruit ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "yeah , I can change the vegetable ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Oh is that broccoli ?

There's plastic for that area around the button .

Uh scroll wheel .

I think that's "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "So I need  where's the cable ? Right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start . Um . Right . This doesn't  okay . Um the method is  we  well I've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing . And um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , and this is  everything's listed down . Um , look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use . These are all things we looked at at the start , um and criteria that have to be met . We have to use a table , I'll show you that later , together to decide whether it meets the standards . And  we we have therefore in total um  We have five  we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated .

No but I imagine even if it was bigger , like if it's round and it's big then you you can't get  that's why remote controls are long because you have that thumb kind of "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "The flat one . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "so c they could all be bananas and cucumbers ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": " Um but I don't s I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there , like it's an awkward position ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I didn't  yeah .

I dunno ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "But if we if we need "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah and just have the colour match or something ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "yeah .

Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So like maybe that's just too big"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Well see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "because "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "which is a nice kind of "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah it's sorta like a joystick ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "yeah .

You know ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah . Yeah . Like uh we could do  I'm trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "'Cause that , I think  I mean that fits the whole round iPod idea ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "And you still have the comfort of holding it like that ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "And you could  like if it's like this , you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah .

Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "so ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So the last uh concept is intelligent . We want uh we want our controller to be smart ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "so maybe we should uh use um uh technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition . Um With this advanced features we  I think we can attract a lot of user ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay . Something else ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay . No . There  this is the three concepts of our controller ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "I just have one question , because for the intelligent controller ,  you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "but as the um expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . Do you think they will be able to use gestures ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , so "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Y"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": " Yeah . Maybe ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . You don't think so ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Uh I think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , sure ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "For example , if you cannot find your uh  controller , you can just uh  just just uh speak something such as , yeah , one two ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "I"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Oh yeah ,  that's a good  that's a good point , so ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "That's true . "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "One and "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , but suppose you got a cold . You have a mute remote controller ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So you can use your gesture . That's no problem . "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah but how how is  how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Broken arm ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay . Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , but suppose you have a family watching tv , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ?

It's "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "But it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built .

Yeah you can you can embed it uh microphone here ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "A microphone maybe ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object .

Yeah , yeah mm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Ecologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "no ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Alrigh In fact , having them both will  if we want to have battery , regular battery and and  the solar energy battery it could be  it'll it will add a little bit of the price ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "but it will be an added value also that will be compensated ,"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "so hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "And what tha what about the uh materials ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "And the materials , it depends for example you  if you have a wooden material it can be more  the plastic material is more common"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Impersonal , mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "it's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Special for "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "or you know , you can have some "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , and i if you  we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm .

For example . It's it's expensive I I guess ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": " I think a touch screen  will be t as expensive as the lcd buttons so ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "But  And it is a kind of other design , I mean . It can also be interesting to have this kind of "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So you got email ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "I dunno .  I think we have only   uh five minutes left ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Participant four ? Functional requirements ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Uh no , trend watching .  The other one . "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "This one ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah . Uh , I think so , just  Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . Um user really really want a fancy look and feel . They're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , okay . Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and  I mean  i i it sounds good technically"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "but it's it's not what they want and uh  So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "At the same time , it's important that it's easy to use . So that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Now i if we look at fashion in general um  Okay . Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Ah yes ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , yeah . Okay , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "'Cause it's it's really what people want . Even if it's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control . And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three . Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from Milan and Paris"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "And fruit and vegetables yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "we go to the fruits and vede vegetables . And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": " Spongy  'Kay ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "okay so this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay , yeah , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "I dunno ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah thi this is this would be like um"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Pla S"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Very stuff  Okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "device , so um"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay , tha tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend in fashion ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy . So ,  as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and  with battery would be something interesting ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah . Solar ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah , so when I think it's "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "maybe will attract"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm-hmm"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "It will be a "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "pro-ecology consumers ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , I think   Yeah , yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Case ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Later ? "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So you think  case .

And it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh Pari  uh France and uh Italy , yeah , uh have detected the following trends . This trends I th uh trend I think it's not um that meaningful for us , maybe . But it's about uh clothes and shoes ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "But the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Spongy ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "But spongy , what what does spongy says ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Spongy ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Spongy , like sponge ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Spongy . Okay . "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So rubber , kind of ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Uh soft materials ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground . So it has to be  flexible ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , but  Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah . Yeah , it's something that uh it stand there . But I didn't knew uh knew what it means .

If it's de like that . That's good , a good idea ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , somewhat like "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , but  Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Is it a bit like like the the the the  remote control ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "How are you gonna make it ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "R_ soft ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ,"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Uh "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I've some uh material uh information , but I'll give you it later in my presentation ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "What do I think ? Uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control , I think about changeable fronts ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Uh maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front . Because it's uh it's hot ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "And uh some basic uh colour fronts .  Uh so we can make uh five different fronts to start with or something . Uh maybe an extraordinary shape , like a sponge .  Uh or uh , yeah , just another shape than a normal uh remote control ha uh has ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Just uh something round in it , or uh maybe not uh not uh  Yeah , I dun dunno . We have to discuss about that . Uh y yeah . Main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative . Yeah , how do we do that ? Maybe speech ? We ma must have some kind of gadget ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , I'll get back on that ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "So "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": " It's very uh difficult to to to do it ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Intro"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Well ,"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah , that's the problem . That's the main problem ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I got f also an email from the the technology department ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "So  Maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "They have done uh research about it , and uh even more possibilities now with speech .

It's mass production .

But how uh we we're gonna make many of those .

That was this ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm uh "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Oh I got an email uh  And it says uh the chip can be uh simple , regular or advanced .

If we're doing uh if we're doing a display ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah okay . So we   Well we can  I had uh to make a sort of a design . So I did some searching on the internet . I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls . I think we should um  This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment . I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players . Mobile phones ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , just modern modern but still uh basic ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "More modern . Y yes . Um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller . 'Cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out  both sides . And here you just have one , few buttons . So that's that's the main difference . But looks uh I definitely think we should go like this . And then changeable fonts , so "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "It's the most important part , I think . But  And the home base is something like that , something simple . Well and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit . Uh basic buttons . On-off , mute . And th maybe two others , I dunno . Text buttons ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , maybe the teletext tel"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , text button , maybe there and there . And then the colour buttons , if we want it on . I don't find it very usable ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "No ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "but it's "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "No , I don't uh  I don't like it ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Uh I don't think it's fits in the the modern theme as well . So "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "and then yeah we saw the the pla display , in the the iPod . They can put the basic buttons , one , two , three , four . And uh f above ten .  And I think "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "But it  That's on on the display ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "No no . That th there is no display there . But it's on the place of the display . And I think we should uh light this up much more than that part ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So the focus is on these two parts ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So you don't see all the buttons you else need ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": " But it sounds very difficult to use . Because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Uh well um "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So you can't use your thumb for it ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "This is how it is now . Um  Here uh  Well we have volume ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I think it is on uh on the bottom too ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "down there . But it's not not the best best ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah . Well here we have also side scrolls . I dunno if we can use that . Do we want to use "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , for volume . For volume , or a channel ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , I've I've got something of that uh too ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , why not ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "For volume ? Well then we can even simplify it more ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Scroll ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "By just putting the volume on the side ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "And the channels as well ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "And and just channel buttons here ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Oh yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "But I think uh "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , or uh maybe uh  The channel buttons are often used . And you can't use them now with your thumb , because the thing is not , it's not easy to control ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Well . Yeah , well it's  Basically it's it's here ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah okay , m maybe we cho should put that on top , and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , that's better ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "They're on top ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , just th th th other buttons like text tv . Put that on the button bottom ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Because uh you can't hold it . You can't hold it th the control and push the buttons ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "You mean uh these to the low ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm . Yeah . Except from the on-off button ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Oh okay . Well , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "But I I think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons , like one two three . So maybe we can put that on the bottom ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm  Maybe . I dunno , but yeah we'll "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Like zapping is just switching one channel at a time ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , maybe it's not easy if it's below . It's harder to zap . So I think uh it should be should be easy to  . I think it's pretty standard , these rubber buttons on the top ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "And uh if you don't light 'em up , they don't uh  you don't see 'em very good ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "That's that's good , but "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": " I think it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up . So the focus gets on these parts and not on there ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "But uh the position of course can be different . It's s We have to look uh what's easy to use , and how it's easier to use ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So we can uh switch these to "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "No , I think th the the top buttons are okay . They sh Those should be on top ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay . Yeah , maybe  "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "But uh we we can switch those two ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Those two , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "And uh , yeah , you have to make sure it's easy to uh  Yes , it has to be big enough so you can hold it , right . "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Well that's that's my findings . So uh my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look . M_P_ three player . And uh well um if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we  I don't think we should put it on top then . I think that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to uh switch it open ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . Yeah , that's cool ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "To use "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So if you put in uh speech recognition , you need so more uh many more buttons . Which won't look good on the front side I think ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "No ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So that's something we have to decide on ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , we have to keep it simple ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "We have to decide this this lecture , or this this this uh fifty minutes , yeah , how it is gonna look ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah . What we're gonna do . Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay , the component design . I looked at uh some similar devices , and uh my own common knowledge . So uh this was on the web site . If you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red . So flashy kinda colours . Uh shapes should be curved , so round shapes . Not  Nothing square-like ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay , so  Hmm , okay . "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah well uh iPod is trendy . And it is well curved  square ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": " Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Square . Like ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , but mm is uh has round corners I think ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay . So not  "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah okay . Not uh the old uh box look ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah . And um sports and gaming device style characteristics . I don't know exactly what that means , but it should be , well yeah , popular kind of"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the  remote control ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "looking , I think ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So the colours also ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm   Yeah , it's "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Black yellow control . "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , mm n Not that weird , because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , but uh  I don't think the the colours black and yellow go well together . But "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "We make i Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "No , okay . That's a that's a sen That's just a matter of tastes , but "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "We have to use uh kind of flashy colours , I think ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Uh can't we use um different uh fron uh fronts , with all with the the logo on it ? Can we do that ? So "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , it's cool . Yep ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah . Like fronts in in red and yellow and blue"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "And still trans"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yes ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Still still transparent ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "and "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Oh yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah . But with all with logo on it ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Well this is a remote control , a very old one . Um   Then the components . The case has just a  Here's black ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , we make it som Maybe we have to make it from soft material . Uh I'm not sure ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , I dunno ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": " Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Maybe . But anyways uh it should be transparent . We decided that , huh ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Well one of the options ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "S"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "You can  Just like a mobile phone , you can make um different fronts on it ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So you can just replace them I think . That was the idea ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , we could do that ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "or just uh release one ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . Just give five with them , just in a box .  Five different "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , uh  Or just uh sell different ones ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , but y you could you could make 'em uh uh like blue and transparent ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . Cool ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So you can still th look through it ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Um the buttons . Normal rubber I think . Like normal ordinary buttons . Soft ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I uh I dunno ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "It it could be like a Nokia , like  plastic ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "A more  Yeah , just uh "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": " Uh uh "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "That's better prob"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "With the hard hard buttons ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I think uh rubber really has an odd look ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah .

Uh it's n doesn't  Is  uh a button uh um   How do you say it ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , it's it's all on one level ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "It it didn't it i it don't come out of the  on the background ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , on one level ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "It is in uh the c a remote control uh "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , I know what you mean . So we have to keep it on the one level . Like th the top it's "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ,"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "like mobile phones . Like uh the iPod ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Uh just "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , that's cool ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay , it's chos So that should be hard plastic .

There's all these kind of things ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Um they they basically said that that's almost the same on any uh remote controls ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I'm sure we can fit in ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So I guess we j we just need that ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I don't know what they do or "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah okay ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay yeah ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "We just "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "you can you can change  Yeah . No ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Nah , but they just said we need it ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Uh the battery contacts , like normal batteries ca you can put in ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , a recharger maybe ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , we have to make sure to uh "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "We still want to have a recharger , don't we ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah but "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Is that still the "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yes . Yes ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , but it i We don't wanna have a ar an  How do you call it ? Accu ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "A recha Oh no . Uh  Battery . It's just a battery . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Re recharger . Base station ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Y uh just just batteries , rechargeable batteries ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , batteries . Yes , rechargeable batteries , I think's best ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay . Not a separate "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "No , just rechargeable batteries ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay . And uh a chip , that's this one ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Then uh I received some possibilities . Um for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic uh  Like with the pulse watch . So it operates on your wrist kinda ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Ah cool . Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "But normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So if you hold it , it gets powered ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "If you hold it . Yeah , I don't think it will work , and  Or we can also use solar cells . But you mostly use it indoors ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "It's dark in the room . No ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "It's just batteries ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "so "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "that's cheaper  ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , and and we can use the home station kind of thing ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Um cases , flat , so uncurved . Uh two D_ curved is um like front to the back . And three D_ curved is also in depth ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So that's possible . Uh but with three D_ uh curved uh remote controls , we must use rubber buttons ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm . So"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So we can't use the flat buttons ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "we need uh two D_ ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . Definitely ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , I think . Um these kinda materials can be used ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "But it doesn't really matter , we just make it plastic ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , I think so too ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "The scroll wheels , that's cool . That's for the volume ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , scroll wheels um "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , that's good . We can use multiple scroll wheels , w if we want to ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "But I think just the volume is enough ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": " Uh  For channels it's not handy ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "because you scroll too fast ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "And uh the lcd .

Just skip it . Because we don't have time for that to to put it in ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay , then we we use m must use the second most expensive chip . So th so the regular chip . Because we use scroll wheels ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "And um  Yeah , that was it I guess ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Uh are are we using a a rubber case , or "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Oh just sk"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "We haven't decided yet ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Maybe you have to skip that one as well . It's "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Uh I don't think a rubber case looks "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "L"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Uh but we have to do something about the trend ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , i it it should be soft . You said so ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "The trend is uh spong spongy uh and uh fruit or fresh fresh ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , okay . That  Uh fruit and veg , or "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "And uh now we have nothing about uh about those those two ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , fruit and veg can be just the covers ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Uh yeah i Just  Just on front ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So you can  the the spongy  yeah , I dunno .

"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I just can't imagine it ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": " So just hard plastic ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , I think ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Titanium . It's mentioned here uh ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Titanium , uh I think it's too expensive ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "But maybe the form has to be a bit different .

Just a bit"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "more rounded ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "you can make it curved or mm round .

Yeah , that's right ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So  We have to decide which one we're going to choose from these . What exactly . Because we have to know it . So the energy uh is the recharger ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "We already know that . Just a normal battery ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah . We have batteries ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay . The chip-on-print is a normal one ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Regular ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay , the case is just a plastic one ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah th yeah , the chip is the the regular one ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , re Yeah , regular . Yeah , okay . Yeah , regular ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "You have the simple one , regular and advanced . So it's b should be regular uh the second ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I think I'll just check it ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "And we need a plastic case , with a scroll wheel . "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yes ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "That's pretty much it ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "And a flashy light ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "User interface concept ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So uh I'm not sure . But we do I don't know if we expected to draw on this one at this moment . But "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I dunno either ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm . Or should we do it in the next meeting ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Uh I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . That's for the next one ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So we should did it here ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "That's for th"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So we're staying here ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Uh that  I think that's the next next meeting ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Or should we do it in the next meeting ? Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "But you definitely get a specific instruction . "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay , so now we're ka thirty minutes alone again ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "But th think about something that's more rounded . Just  And more  It has to be "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , uh I dunno . But the iPod and etcetera , M_P_ three players , mobile phones ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Uh a bit . Just just on the top or on the bottom ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Just a bit cur Okay , I'll see if I can see any of those ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Maybe the wheel can be uh like uh like this . O um if you draw it like this , you get a  What the fuck is it ?  Okay . Mm  Doesn't work .  You see what I mean ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": " What ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "If I draw here   It draws about four centimetres lower than  "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Oh . Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Nah okay . Just  . Maybe you can make it like this . And this is all the wheel for volume . So that you just um  It's all rounded , so you can do uh turn this one ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Like a very big scroll-wheel . "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , but just not on the top , but uh on the side of it ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Maybe , I dunno ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay , so we  have this at the moment ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I think uh you'll get a a lot of uh volume changing when it's not wanted ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , you  "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay , so"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "we'd have this . Is that okay ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "that's a little problem , of course , as well ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I think it's probably better ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "And "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , but maybe we can make a a plastic , so that you i if you like drop it , it won't change the volume . Only if you use your finger ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , maybe you just have to make it uh  That's not scrollable too easy ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Like this . And uh what's the channel choose ? Where do we uh put that ? Still on the bottom"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I think in middle ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "or "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Uh wh what is the middle part ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "That's the numbers ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Numbers , okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Uh I think th the numbers should be in the bottom , and and the switch channel in the middle ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , I agree as well ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "It doesn't make a difference , if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Use the dz"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Because you already have the volume here , so  You can also put it here one butt and the other one there . Next to each other .  back and forth ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , that's right ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So you can also can put it all on the top , and this , you keep this empty . Because you have to hold it as well ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Or you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "But that's not  want to zap very quick , so "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , I think uh zapping is the highest priority ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ? Is this a opportunity ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "And then you use those uh "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "or you don't want a different "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , of course uh ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Uh but I think we we should bu uh put 'em on top of each other , so "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Why ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Because then it's it's easy to know m if I push the the the up "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "But still the next  It's still the next one . Doesn't make "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , but the top the top button is is like you switch channel up , and down button is   If you put them "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , but fo from left to right is exactly the same . It ma it doesn't make a big difference ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah . I I think it's  It's it's obvious , I think ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "But uh but I I think uh left to right is more often associated with volume , and top down is more with uh channel changing ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah , that's not not  It's not al uh always the same ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "But it's exactly th"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "In uh  On most on most remote controls ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Every remote control's uh different ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , I think "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So so if we use that , they will probably have a long learning uh time ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "I dunno . I  You already have the volume on the side ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "No , uh I think "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "so you can't make it you can't ma make a mistake ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So it's uh "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I think it's s so simple"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I dunno ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "you just "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So but that's for that's for you ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "'cause it's "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , okay I'll d I'll take a look at it ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay , so hmm . What did  What else we have to discuss about ? I dunno ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Think we need to work uh thirty minutes again ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah , we have to care that it r uh looks really new . Because uh we still hold on to the uh ordinary uh uh square uh remote control ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "'Cause wha what I see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "And the LED ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "No , you have uh  It is "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , but i i it should be round in in shape ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Uh the current uh controllers are all black and plastic ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "You have to look at that image of the iPod ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yes . Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "More that uh kind of style ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "And a bit uh "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Not not the old grey black "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Uh  Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Some some kind of bling bling uh mm can we have "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Where you can put a ve Uh we have  If we do it like that we have below have we uh a lot of room to put a nice logo ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . Uh the logo was has to be on there . Yeah , that's right ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Uh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then ? Uh five or something ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , five . Let's give five ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Or more or "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Maybe you can buy separate ones and uh "}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "And um uh  uh buy the product . You buy , you get one . And uh basic ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah . Um"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Or you can choose one uh if you buy the project ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I think  Yeah . That's your choice , I think huh ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "No , tha that will be "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ? Is that is that a good good opportunity ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yes ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So you could put it like that ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , so top down ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Hmm ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah , you sl uh you let it slide in the docking station ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Do we have to design that w as well ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah . "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Uh I'm not sure ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "The docking station ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , I think so ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "But th Yeah , that can be very simple . Least ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah , we can b It c it could be just just a square , just a packet ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , just a recharger ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , just where you're around something . Li Yeah , we had one example ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm . Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Which w"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "but that's a round one . Maybe we can choose then ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Here you see one that's very round ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Oh yeah , okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So I think that can be all kind of shapes ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit . That's all ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Of the remote control ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Just round it up  ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , so y you don't want uh this uh like the iPod  . But "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "No . Yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "More rounded . Yeah , I think it will just look like more like this one . Since it's  This is also rounded ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "No , just just the corners ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I think i"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah okay , tho those are al already a bit cornered . Mm  "}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , but we can we can do all kinds of uh  As long as it isn is in two D_ we can use all kind of round shapes ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Shapes ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah okay , but then we have to think of something totally new ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Not in depth . Yeah , but   Yeah , if if we want to make it kind of , yeah , new ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I've uh  I had a lot of picture of old ones .

And uh just with uh together with uh the back-lights b look will look very new ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "No rubber buttons or something . Just together with the back-lights you'll get a totally new look . More like the M_P_ three player M_ um P_ M_ P_ three player ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": " Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "And you have the scroll button inside .  Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yes . Just a simple scrollb"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then ?

What  the first thing  question I asked was what are we trying to design ? Well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the tv to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the tv or other appliance that it's sending the signal to . Um , so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that  well it wasn't really my area because  I'm dealing with the inside really . So um , yeah I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one  ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Um and uh  I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the tv presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you don't need to send very much information . Um , most of them are powered by some form of battery . Now our one , I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm-hmm . Could I  can I interject to ask a question there ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah sure ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "is that appropriate ? You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the  surrounding it ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Um no no , if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries ,"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Right , the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah the the "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "They are ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Oh I see ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "and how much you need to send the data across ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . Um , now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller .  Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work , uh as I said about the  w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the tv unless they're in a cinema , which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine .

And then finally , um we want uh the  it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that I've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good . Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that I was thinking about , uh because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of  d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa  thing that you could have ,"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm .

Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um , I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable . So purpose , as William already said , I would put it to simplify the interaction with tv to make make it as simple as possible . And to summarise I I would say it's  it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering  maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will  this two features together . So what the concept is to have a flip-top model . The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you  you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top . So it's like  it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh  added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's not  of no use of punching in the uh  trying to put in those things in  on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . As we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said ? Yeah ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "with that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in  add in more features and make it less costly . Um , that's  so this is  if you ask me personally , I would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use  usage and all that ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So in overall a simple and uh user-friendly design ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Uh any comments like , if you want ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "'Kay . Um , I think we'll chat about it at the end ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end , um "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah sure ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "'Kay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Ooh , it's vibrating , that's strange .

Look at that ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay , um , I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research .  Um , so that's where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there .  Our findings , lots of findings , I've just summarised some of them here . The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there . Um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but um that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking . Um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall . For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping . So again there's power implications there .  Um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there . Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control . Um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that . Uh thirty four percent of people take  said they take too much time to learn to use and I think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions . Um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury . You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems . Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid I think in uh  when they've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition . Something we didn't put to them , but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . Um , that trend reverses in the older age groups .

And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time .

The infrared L_E_D_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it . Um , we need a radio sender and receiver , those are standard . And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote . So we have some material options . Um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium .

Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan .  Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls . They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use .

So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , uh again in contrast to last year .

Okay . Um first about my role , role of the Industrial Designer . I would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . So if someone of you comes up with uh ideas , uh I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but uh there might be some impossibilities . So that's one .  Uh I also will propose some uh um uh some implementations for that , but  well , these are quite the same . Sorry about that . Um and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I have some uh initial ideas about some things um which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming uh discussion . One thing about uh interopera operability . Um I think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device  diverse subset of equipment . Uh for instance , uh D_V_D_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment .

Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I think it could come in handy . We should discuss that .

Um I I do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Um Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications . Um there are other things like um  how to make it trendy , which is I think uh um most uh Ru uh Ruud's uh role .

Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": " Um  Well , the techni fu technical function uh   what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the tv .

"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Well , that's just the fu the technical function is  pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task uh as an uh as an uh device ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "It just should change the tv's state ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So that's it .

Uh point at a tv , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the tv ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "so you must  point everywhere , so maybe infrared is "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Maybe not even pointed . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should uh maybe uh be restriction to that ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": " Uh "}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Uh is that uh  are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ?

The marks ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay , um I ha I have one point f um which which comes in mind now . Um uh d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm-hmm . Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "um or it should not consume too much um power . Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s uh uh every other week ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": " So um maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "But um  Necessary , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "yeah . I dunno , it's uh   that's more Sebastian's uh um "}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah .
